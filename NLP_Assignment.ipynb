I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.',\n",

On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document. I am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself.

I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn\\'t have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who\\'s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction.

She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, \\'\\' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase \\'s advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.',\n",

I contacted chase around noon today XX/XX/2019 and was asked the last 4 numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction. Never been declined by either chase or XXXX  XXXX before - today after multiple assurances that I was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did',\n",

I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim.

The closing date was XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached statement ). That statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows that I had an outstanding purchase balance of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were NO other purchases prior to the one on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nHowever, when I got the XXXX statement, it shows that I still have a purchase balance of {$210.00}. I have a promotional balance (@XXXX ) in XXXX of {$6900.00}. In XXXX, the promotional balance was {$7200.00} - a difference of {$380.00}. \\n\\nApparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by Chase ) I thought would be applied to the purchase (@ 21.49 % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. It is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. This is not the first time that Chase has skirted US Financial Law to turn a larger profit. I need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at Chase.

IF you already have a SWA Chase personal card, do not apply for the new one online. This has sent me through a XXXX triangle, wasting my time and therefore money. \\n\\nIt appears in the middle of XX/XX/2018, Chase expanded their undisclosed 5/24 rule to include ALL co-branded cards, not just SWA, yet the marketing machine continues to ignore this policy and the Agents on the phone are not well trained. I am contacting the credit bureau b/c two of the cards opened are not mine - that is the silver lining here. \\n\\nHowever, the issue with incessant marketing of their branded cards to customers, plus this confusing 5/24 rule and lack of Agent phone training, is false advertising. The information is still relatively opaque, as Chase never comments on the 5/24 rule, but multiple reader and community data points suggest denials due to 5/24 for cards previously exempt. \\n\\nCFPB staff, please help educate consumers and hold the big banks accountable for deceptive trade practices. I do not believe this is intentional on Chase 's part, but the second to last Agent did encourage me to file a complaint here, so be it. \\n\\nThank you! \\n\\nXXXX\",\n",

Now they are saying that the offer was over at the time and they have given me a much less valuable sign-up promotion that doesn't include the companion pass. The companion pass was the entire reason we signed-up and the reason the card was promoted to me. They have informed me that the offer was from Jan 10-Feb 11 and that my cc shows approval on the XXXX XXXX. The supervisor I spoke to said that they specifically don't send out offer details to confirm your offer when you sign up ( thus denying me evidence ) but also that they can't fix it without this evidence.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a secure message to Chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open Chase cards. I also followed up with a phone call that same week, and the representative I spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase indicating that my \" disputed charge \\'\\' would remain on my account and \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account. \\'\\' I followed up with a phone call to Chase describing that this was a refund, not a dispute. The representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts. I explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds. They informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund I am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails I received from the merchant about the refund ( see Attachment ).  On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase with similar language about \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account \\'\\' and \" we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research \\'\\' ( see Attachment ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with the merchant, XXXX XXXX, requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds. On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded ( see Attachment ). This was my last exchange trying to resolve this between the credit card or the merchant.',\n",

The bases of the dispute is that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took us to 1 island only and did not follow thru with the itinerary that had been planned out. Most of the conversation was over the phone. At the end of the day with much confusion XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX charged my card {$4400.00} for services NOT rendered. This is the cause of the dispute. I tried dealing with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they were not budging on refunding us partial payment due to not following the itinerary that had been planned. So I then went to my Credit Card Chase Sapphire Dispute Department to resolve the issue. After many, many phone calls and months of dealing with this dispute, our Credit Card has sided with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX word over ours on what went on that day. Basically XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has continuously lied about the events that day and even said they gave us a credit which was also another lie. I have spent so much time on this and can not believe that we as customers with a very good history have to deal with our Credit Card on this level. \\n\\nThere was another large group lead by XXXX XXXX on this excursion who also felt they were not given what was promised.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I am writing you to file a complaint about an unresolved issue with my credit card chase and their benefit and travel departments. This has been my second travel related credit issue with chase. My first experience with chase was also about a credit that they were supposed to process. Chase was either unresponsive or slow. I finally ended up contacting the airlines directly and got a much quicker response and resolution from them. \\n\\nMy more recent issue with Chase has been my most stressful and frustrating experience when dealing with any credit card company or for that matter any other company that offers products or services. I am a Chase Sapphire card holder who has been using the card regularly for purchases amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars every month. I have an excellent payment history with most of the bills paid in full every month. \\n\\n\\nIn XXXX  of 2019, I bought my XXXX airline ticket for an overseas trip through Chase using my accumulated Chase points. My father passed away overseas a week before my trip. I had to cancel my original trip and leave immediately so I called chase to cancel my ticket. Despite, under a lot of stress and in grief, I had to be on the phone with them for hours. I was put on long holds, transferred to different departments and still did not receive a definitive answer about cancelation of my trip and credit to my account. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the last customer representative that I spoke with that night, they had to send an email to a different department and that I could follow up with them the following week by Tuesday or Wednesday as they would have processed my cancelation by then. Unfortunately, It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to be calling from overseas and be on the phone with the credit card company for hours. I had to authorize my husband to follow up on my behalf the following week before his upcoming trip overseas as he had to leave on XX/XX/XXXX, which was our original plan. \\n\\n\\nMy husband called them few times and went through the same process of being on the phone for hours either being on hold or being transferred to different departments. He spoke with the main customer service, the benefits and the chase travel. Initially, a representative advised him to contact XXXX  directly to cancel my ticket. Finally, after further research, the same representative that he spoke to in the benefit department told him that we should expect to receive a credit because of the death in the family, The representative assigned us a case number and told my husband that Chase would get the refund from XXXX on our behalf. According to him, all we needed was a death certificate. Since we were both expected to be out of the country for few weeks, the representative told my husband that the credit could be processed anytime upon our return or soon after the Chase received the death certificate from us. \\n\\nIn XXXX, while still overseas, I received an e-mail on XXXX, XXXX from XXXX in Chase travel who was following up with the death certificate. I e-mailed Chase travel department the scanned copy of the death certificate as soon as it became available to me. I even e-mailed them a translation of the death certificate which was neither required by Chase or XXXX. I sent it to XXXX who had contacted me on XXXX, XXXX by responding to her e-mail from XXXX, XXXX and then forwarded it again to her to make sure that they received it. For personal and family reasons, I ended up staying a little longer than expected and retuned to the United States on XXXX. There was still no acknowledgment from XXXX or anyone from Chase Travel or any other department acknowledging the receipt of my e-mail from XXXX or any other update. Soon after my return, I had to send the travel department my father 's death certificate for the third time and even tried to follow up with a phone call. I also tried to send them an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX, expressing my disappointment and requesting an update. I also tried to correspond with Chase customer service and Chase travel through my online chase account. \\n\\nChase travel finally responded with an acknowledgement through an e-mail that they had received and located the death certificate that I had sent them. The e-mail was from XXXX, one of the Travel consultant supervisor for chase travel. According to her, they had forwarded the death certificate to XXXX. She apologized for my experience with them and also asked me to disregard any other emails from them requesting documentation. During this whole ordeal with Chase, I had contacted XXXX numerous times and spoke to different representatives. According to XXXX, In order for Chase to process my credit, they didn't need to forward the death certificate to XXXX. \\n\\nIn one of my initials calls to Chase after my return to the United States, I found out that the case number / reference number assigned to us and given to my husband by the by chase benefits department in XXXX could not be used as a reference because I was told that it did not exist in their system. In XXXX and XXXX, I spoke to several people and few supervisors hoping that they could resolve my issue. Customer service agents who seemed willing to help did not have the authority to resolve my issue as there was no outcome and I ended up wasting several hours without any resolution in sight. \\n\\nThere was one supervisor in Chase travel department, which was probably being managed by XXXX, named XXXX, whom I ended up speaking with twice. During our brief conversation, She flatly refused to help me or answer any questions. She had the most condescending attitude that I have ever experienced from an agent affiliated with any company. She refused to give me an update or call XXXX. She refused to transfer me to her manager or anyone that could assist me. To top it all, she told me I needed a proof that I was related to the deceased which was contrary to what I had been told up till that point that all I needed was a death certificate. I called XXXX and according to them, a proof of relationship was not necessary or required. XXXX told me that it was their policy that all that was needed was a death certificate and Chase should have processed my credit as soon as they received it. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I emailed and I called Chase few times and each time I was promised that a supervisor would get back to me which never happened. One of the last representatives that that I spoke with was on XXXX, XXXX, who was from Chase benefits department. To my utter shock and surprise, he told me that they didn't have any type of claim for me on file. I was beyond hope at that point. He then transferred me once again to their travel department. The representative there told me that they were still waiting to hear from XXXX. I requested to speak with a supervisor and she told me it would be two hours before I could speak with one. She promised that a supervisor would call me back but as always, I never heard from anyone. \\n\\nAfter several weeks on the phone with Chase and after speaking to XXXX multiple times who repeatedly told me that the delay was from Chase, I finally decided that I would wait and see if the issue would be resolved. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Chase has still not processed my credit and followed up or called back in response to any of my previous phone calls even when they promised that I would receive a phone call. \\n\\nI have finally decided that I am going to file a formal complaint with every private, state and federal consumer protection agency or organization. I would share my experience on any relevant online or offline forums available to me. I have been a great customer. I may have been frustrated with my experience but have always been respectful in my communications with Chase or its representatives. I have been managing my credit responsibly over the years, had several premium credit card offers as I had met their criteria to apply for their cards with similar benefits as Chase Sapphire. I decided to go with Chase and was hopeful that I would take advantage of their travel benefits. I spent thousands of dollars using my Chase card even though some of my other cards also offered attractive benefits. \\n\\nAs stated earlier, I fulfilled my obligation of using credit responsibly and of paying my bills. Chase on the other hand, failed to issue me a credit and fulfill its promise. A timely credit, under the circumstances, was my right. It was according to and within the rules set by both the Chase and XXXX Airlines. Unfortunately, I was never able to utilize the points that I had accumulated. A credit card company at the very least should treat every customer with respect, follow their own rules, keep their promises and follow up with their customers and if required and within the rules, be its customer 's adovocate on his or her behalf when dealing with third parties. I feel that Chase fell short of these basic standards and expectations. It with deep regret that I have to reconsider my business relationship with them. It is a shame that a well known company like Chase offering a premium card such as, Chase Sapphire and charging a $ XXXX yearly membership fee for it, would have such a poor service. It is either a case of extreme mismanagement by chase or a system deliberately designed in such a way that it only benefits the company at the expense of its customers.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"On XX/XX/2019, I paid off my Chase credit card in full and early for the third time in the four months I've had the card. When I paid the card off, the CS rep on the phone gave me a temporary credit increase so that I could use my card while the funds cleared. I paid {$3000.00}. I went to use my card on XX/XX/2019, and it was declined even though my online app said I had over {$2000.00} credit available. The purchase that was declined was a {$21.00} charge. I thought it might be the place where I was trying to use it, so I tried again with a charge a little over $ XXXX..again declined. I called XX/XX/2019, and the automated system said my card was declined due to insufficient funds, so I talked to another rep. She said Chase was holding my money, and I told her my XXXX XXXX XXXX account was drawn for the {$3000.00} on XX/XX/2019 and that the last rep I spoke with had given me a temporary increase so that this wouldn't happen. She said that was true, but the temporary time period ended before they released the funds. To me, this is theft, since they are drawing interest on my money that I can no longer access nor use what I paid for ... credit on my Chase credit card. I also missed out on airline points I could have accumulated. This is the second time this has happened to me.I expect Chase to be treated as any criminal who steals.\",\n",

I careful read all of the disclosures and was sure to follow all steps correctly to be eligible for both offers to receive the combined {$500.00} offer. I opened my accounts online on Chase \\'s website on XX/XX/XXXX. To date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I still have not received either offer, despite numerous attempts to work with Chase employees to resolve this. ( On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited {$20000.00} into the savings account, well within the 20 business days of account opening. ) When I contacted Chase at the  end of XXXX to discuss my concern. I called the customer service line and spoke with a supervisor. He informed me there was nothing he could do without the coupon code. I explained I do not have the coupon code ( at the time ) and the call ended. I later found the coupon code and called back. During this call a lady informed me that regardless of having the coupon code there was nothing that could be done to investigate/resolve this. She then told me the reason I did not receive the bonus offers for opening either account is because I did not enter the coupon code at the time I opened the account online. That was the only reason I did not receive the bonus amounts. \\n\\nDuring the online account opening process Chase \\'s website stated \" If you open the account online, your coupon code will be automatically applied \\'\\'. Furthermore, the email I received ( will be attached for reference ) specifically states, \" Your coupon code will be automatically applied. Account ( s ) subject to approval. \\'\\' As a result, two sources confirmed that the coupon code would be automatically applied, therefore I don\\'t recall entering the coupon, because it was being added automatically for me. \\n\\nI am very frustrated with my Chase experience and the lack of payment of these bonus offers I rightfully earned. After phone customer service supervisors told me there was nothing they could do I contacted local branch management. They advised me to contact the phone customer service and said they could not help me. I am very upset about this entire experience. I want to be compensated {$500.00} to cover the {$200.00} and {$300.00} offers I should have earned. I followed all of the terms and disclosures correctly. Please investigate this matter and contact me back. Thank you',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"This complaint is a follow up regarding a complaint # XXXX filed on cfpb. \\n\\nThe original complaint was regarding a dispute detailed below. \\n\\nMy laptop was stolen last year and someone used my information to book two flights from two different cities headed to the same destination. I immediately disputed the transactions as soon as i got a notification.i filed the complaint within an hour of getting notification that flights have been booked on my credit card. chase was extremely slow to respond and didnt do due diligence and contact the airline right away to cancel the flight and get me a refund. \\nChase did a very poor job at investigating the incident and put the charges back on my credit card without doing a proper investigation. when i asked, i was told that i benefited from the transactions. Clearly, i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination. later, the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights. chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop, proof that the flights were booked under my name. however, the date of births used to book the flights were not mine. Clearly, i couldnt have benefited from the services even if i wanted to. \\nThe way chase handled the dispute was extremely poor and after multiple bad experiences and inability of chase to resolve disputes, i am pretty positive that chase is horrible at resolving disputes. \\nI am over that but this complaint i am filing is NOT about the original claim.Please read below about this complaint. \\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY! \\n\\nAfter this incident, i contacted XXXX and inquired about the flight. They told me that they found too bookings for the same person headed to the same destination from two destinations and cancelled one of the bookings and issued a refund. Chase has NOT contacted XXXX ONCE to resolve this issue. XXXX has confirmed several times that they have issued me a refund and the money has been transferred to my bank account. However, chase hasnt issued me a refund. Whenever i contact chase, they give me same old response. the case has been closed. I am not opening the same claim. Its a new complaint. XXXX has issued me a refund and it hasnt been given to me by chase. XXXX 's customer service can not connect me to the accounting team and therefore it not possible for me to find the transaction and details.This is chase banks job! connect with them and find out whats going on. Instead chase is asking me to contact XXXX and prove that the refund has been issued. XXXX is telling me to have my bank contact their accounting department because its a banks job to resolve this issues.Now, i am filing a new complaint demanding my money with interest and all the time chase has wasted. \\nI am attaching the documents that XXXX has provided me. Chase has asked me to provide these documents. Its chase 's job but i am doing this ob their behalf. \\n\\nXXXX is clearly stating that the bank has the funds. They have also provided me a document showing that transaction details that the refund was applied to my account. \\n\\nPlease issue me a refund. I have done everything i could have. Please, DO NOT close my complaint without issuing me a refund that XXXX has issued a long time ago! \\nEnough is enough!\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I purchased tickets ( using my XXXX XXXX XXXX Chase Credit Card ) for my family of four and my two parents to go overseas from the US to XXXX for the first time last fall. I purchased through a discount airline ( XXXX ), as it would not have been financially possible with another carrier. Our tickets were round trip, not purchased as individual one way fares. Four tickets were purchased for my family on XX/XX/XXXX ( and my parents tickets were purchased XX/XX/XXXX. All six of us flew from the US XX/XX/XXXX. My family of four were set to return XX/XX/XXXX, with my parents set to return XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nAs XXXX Airlines began experiencing financial difficulties, they started changing and cancelling flights. My return was cancelled because my flight from XXXX to XXXX wasnt being flown. I was told by XXXX if I could get to XXXX on another airline, I could catch a flight from XXXX back to the US with XXXX. Needing to get back to work as a teacher, I booked 4 flights from XXXX to XXXX at my own expense. Two days later XXXX failed altogether. My new tickets to XXXX were now worthless as XXXX could no longer able to get me back to the US and no other carriers had flights to my destination. \\n\\nBecause of this, I was forced to buy new tickets from XXXX to the US on United Airlines for all 6 passengers. Obviously, this caused some serious stress throughout our trip and also some serious financial strain that was unexpected. The return flight I purchased were as much as the round trip tickets I had originally purchased on WOW, so my airfare essentially doubled. \\n\\nUpon contacting Chase when I got home, I was told that I would only partially be refunded because I was provided partial service. The customer service representative and supervisor ( both of which were friendly ) equated it to buying a pair of pants and a shirt. If the pants were not acceptable, I still have to pay for the shirt. My contention is a little different. I purchased 6 round trip tickets, all part of the same trip. The service I purchased was to get me to my destination AND get me back to my origin all as one transaction. \\n\\nI was not left in a better position by being flown across the world and left with not so much as an email from XXXX that they were closing. I incurred additional flight, lodging, food, etc. My questions for the representatives were simple, but with no adequate responses. \\n\\n1. If I buy a flight with a connection, if I am flown to the connecting city, but not flown to my destination, is this considered a service? Should I have to pay for part of a flight? \\n2. If I pay someone to put on a new roof, and they tear it off, but dont put new shingles back on, do I have to pay for partial service? \\n\\nIn both of these cases, just like my case, we were not left in a better position. We were most definitely left in a much worse position. If XXXX was still in business, I would be asking them for a complete refund, and if that did not work, I would be suing them for damages. According to XXXX XXXX XXXX, which would have applied if they were still in business, I would have been entitled to XXXX Euros per flight for the original cancellation of my return as well as the cancellation of the rescheduled flight. They would also be liable for lodging, new flights booked, food etc. In total, this would add up to literally $ XXXX. \\n\\nYet, I am being told by Chase, that XXXX in some way provided me something for which I should be grateful enough to pay {$1500.00} of the original {$3000.00}. \\n\\nIn actuality, it seems much more likely that Chase is not willing to take on this liability since XXXX is not here anymore to refund me the money. However, this is why I use my credit card to make these purchases consumer protection. \\n\\nI have worked through multiple levels of employees, but non have been empowered to make an actual decision beyond \" sorry, company policy. \\'\\'',\n",

I submitted a fraud dispute with the bank at the time and today XX/XX/2019 found out that the bank Chase debited my account to the venue in which the fraud dispute was made.

It was then found that my debit card had been use to make multiple transactions totaling {$2800.00} between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Actions I Have Personally Taken To Resolve The Issue XX/XX/XXXX After beginning to receive claims paperwork, I immediately notified Chase claims department. The first claims specialist I spoke with was very rude. She kept badgering me about the final transaction on my account. When I couldn\\'t provide her the information, she to call me back when I had the proper information and hung up. I called back and spoke with a guy named XXXX. I explained the situation to XXXX. He had me verify my last know transaction. After verifying my last known transaction, XXXX took a look at the claims made from XX/XX/XXXX. I advised XXXX that these were claims that I did not call in to reverse. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 2nd call I would make in 48 hours. The claim \\'s specialist, once again, was very rude. When I called back, I told the claim \\'s specialist I would like to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I finally became frustrated and hung up. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX This was the 3rd attempt made to ( attempt to ) get help in recovering my money. To get any answers, I had to use a potential review to the XXXX XXXX XXXX about Chase \\'s claims practices and protocols. I was then transferred to Chase \\'s Executive Office to escalate my claim. It was at the Executive Office that I spoke with XXXX. XXXX opened Claim XXXX on my behalf. She said once my claim was assigned to an Executive Office employee, that person would contact me at the number on file. \\n\\nXXXX - Mid XXXX My case was assigned to XXXX in the Executive office. We spent roughly 2 weeks before either one of us spoke on the phone - although she had left a handful of voicemails. I first spoke with XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. I told her about the multiple claims that were opened against an account I had since closed. She claimed she only received two of the claims against the account. After speaking with me she assured me she was going to \" investigate \\'\\' all the claims made that were made beginning at the end of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed multiple payments being deducted from my Chase checking account. In the description, all I saw were numbers. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to see why money was being debited from my account. Of course, all I got was XXXX \\'s voicemail. I left a message requesting a return call. By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received a return call. I called XXXX once again because money was still being debited from my account. This time I got a hold of XXXX. Her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd. She told me that while they were \" investigating \\'\\' these open claims, money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voicemail from XXXX to call her as soon as possible. I returned her call once school was dismissed for the day. It was at that point, that XXXX told me they closed their \" investigation \\'\\' of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision. When asked what research they used to complete their \" investigation \\'\\' XXXX became short and told me I would have to subpoena the information. At that point, I hung up because I felt that it was a lose lose situation.',\n",

Okay, so I understand that. This was on Friday, XX/XX/2019. I did not apply for credit following that. Imagine my surprise when I got another alert on Saturday afternoon, XX/XX/2019. The alert said that \" JPMCB Card Services \\'\\' had pulled my credit report ( another hard inquiry ). I immediately looked up JPMCB and it said it was a Chase company. I looked up customer service so I could find out what was going on and was told that no one is available in credit reporting on the weekends - only Monday- Friday. I was understandably upset as I had not applied anywhere on Saturday. What if someone was attempting to obtain credit under my name, I asked? I was told that they still couldn\\'t help me since it was the weekend. What kind of company in this day and age of security breaches does not have someone available on the weekends? If credit is able to be pulled on the weekends, someone should be available on the weekends to assist should there be an issue. I still have no resolution nor any indication of why my credit would be pulled when I did not ask for it to be, particularly when it was an additional hard inquiry and I do not have an account with Chase.',\n",

I was NEVER informed that I would be removed from Ultimate Rewards, so over the last 3-4 months I spent approximately {$10000.00} on my Chase Ink card with no rewards in return. Chase also proactively liquidated my rewards account. \\n\\nWhen I asked why this was done without informing me, the agent referenced a change of terms notification I received in XX/XX/XXXXthat would have informed me of this action. The change of terms notification, however, did no such thing. No mention of government entity, rewards, etc. When I asked to escalate the case to resolve it, I was told that it was too late -- I missed the deadline. Yes, a deadline I was never given. \\n\\nI believe this is a violation of UDAAP and potentially other regulations.

It is clear that both payeeing bank and Chase acted in violation of the UCC and our deposit agreement with Chase in paying this check without checking the endorsement and thus paid over an improper endorsement. Apart from being out over {$10000.00} we are aggravated by the fact that Chase has taken the position that our firm acquiesced, to reduce their costs and thus increase their profitability, in their assuming the business risk of not checking endorsements and thus we have no basis for complaint with respect to the 60 days taken so far in crediting our account in spite of the fact that Chase \\'s policy was at variant with the UCC and their deposit contract with us.',\n",

Back on XX/XX/XXXX, this very same thing happened. We had a balance of {$130.00} and I had 3 charges come in to my accountone for {$350.00}, one for {$69.00} and another for {$46.00}. The bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me 3 overdraft fees in the amount of {$34.00} each. When I called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger items are more important items like house payments, car payments, etc. The bank has reimbursed us before for this practice, but told me this is a one-time courtesy and will not do it again. \\nHad those charges been done in reverse order, we would have had only one charge.

Following this situation a person called me claiming to be partners with the company that sent me the money, this person told me that he was interested in giving me a job, the job was to take the amount of {$4100.00} out of my bank account ( the money he sent ) through the ATM and deposited into one of his accounts. I immediately knew that something wasnt right. So What I did was I send the money back to the original sender ( Company in Colorado ) in two electronic  payments of {$2000.00} each totaling {$4000.00}. \\nA day after I completed this transactions the bank froze my account, I went to the bank and spoke with the claims department and notified them about this issue, I also notified them that I sent the companys money back to them and that I only needed to send back {$170.00} more. Now this company in Colorado made a claims against the original transaction, which the bank ( knowing about the fact that I gave them their money back ) approved their claim and debited my account for the total of {$4100.00} creating an overdraft in my account. So now this Company in Colorado have kept {$4000.00} extra out of my expense because the bank Forgot about the two transactions of {$2000.00} that I sent back. I called the bank so that they could reverse the two transactions of {$2000.00} each and they denied my claim. I think this is really unfair because the bank should be responsible for this matter since they authorized a debit to my account knowing that I gave the money back to the original sender. Now Im negative {$3000.00} in my account and the bank is telling me that I have to pay for it.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Some 3rd party fraudulent XXXX account made more than a dozen unauthorized transactions ( total close to {$20000.00} ) into my Chase savings bank account. These transactions spanned over a period of 6 months ( XX/XX/2018 - XX/XX/2018 ). \\n\\nUpon reporting ( on XX/XX/2018 ) to Chase bank about the fraudulent transactions, Chase returned roughly {$1800.00} back which fell in the first 60 days of the first unauthorized transaction. Chase notified me that they are not able to recover any additional funds beyond first 60 days because they have liability for 60 days only and that ideally I should have called them within first 60 days of the first transaction. Since then I have added additional alerts on my bank account to monitor it more closely. \\n\\nI called XXXX right away and reported those same transactions almost the same time as I reported to Chase. XXXX requested me to go back to Chase bank and ask Chase Bank to file ACH return request. XXXX assured that as soon as they received the ACH return request from Chase they will return all the remaining funds back to me. \\n\\nAfter multiple follow ups, Chase finally filed ACH late return request to return the funds to the originating bank. However, Chase filed these ACH late return requests with XXXX XXXX ( another bank which had pulled the money in the first place ) and not XXXX ( who is the merchant ). Multiple Chase bank representatives assured me that this is the right way to do it and this is the only way Chase bank can do it. \\n\\nIt's been more than 2 months since the ACH late return requests were made to XXXX XXXX but they have not responded. Chase Bank waits for 2-3 weeks for XXXX XXXX to respond and after that makes a new request to recover funds. However till date XXXX XXXX has not responded and I have not received my money even though XXXX have told me that they will return all funds. \\n\\nI keep following up with both Chase and XXXX every 1-2 weeks but I'm not getting much luck with either one of them. Often times I get different confusing answers from both Chase and XXXX. \\n\\nMany tell me that the fact that XXXX XXXX is not responding to Chase is not normal. One bank   ought to respond when the other is trying to talk. \\n\\nI need help from Chase, XXXX and XXXX XXXX to get my {$18000.00} back.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Early in XXXX I became the XXXX XXXX of the US office of a XXXX company. The U.S. office of the company was incorporated in Delaware as a separate entity. There is a sole owner who also owned the XXXX based entity. \\nOur bank was Chase, and XXXX XXXX our bank contact, based on a relationship with prior foreign company I had been running at the same location with the same infrastructure and bookkeeper. XXXX relationship with Mr. XXXX dated from from XXXX or XXXX. The Chase relationship dated from XXXX. \\n\\nIn early XXXX of XXXX I asked XXXX XXXX about a small line of credit. The company produced TV commercial and in production oftentimes equipment and locations need to be paid in advance, or require deposits. In addition there is travel. I had been using my own ( personal ) credit card. Given XXXX was slow in paying us money owed, I was getting concerned. \\n\\nXXXX called me a few days later and said he had a better solution and put me in touch with XXXX XXXX, at the bank, to open a company credit card. He assured me it would be set up as a corporate card and I would have no liability. I reiterated I was doing this as I was using my own card and did not want any liability. \\nThe card application was made on-line during a phone call with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX initiated the call.. After we spoke, he transferred me to XXXX XXXX. She guided me through the process. I specifically said to her I did not want the card if I would be liable if something happened with the company. I explained that I knew of instances where employee had cards in their names and were held liable. She clearly told me I was covered in the event of any kind of default. She told me the company was responsible and I was \" protected \\'\\' ( her word ) On that same call XXXX guided me through the on-line application. I never signed anything. The official card date of issue is XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI left XXXX at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and closed the office for them, although the company was kept open. The part time bookkeeper stayed on. The XXXX company declared insolvency in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX XXXX in the US has never actually closed. The owner stopped responding to anything in XXXX. The XXXX Chase Bank account remains open with a small balance. \\n\\nDuring the last week XXXX of XXXX, when I closed the physical office of XXXX XXXX in the US. Everything was given to the part time bookkeeper who was the one that handled all the financial affairs and bank business. She was known to XXXX XXXX and had interacted on a regular basis. She was given the checkbook and the card, and she had all current records. All further Chase business should be would be forwarded to her P.O. box. The monthly statements had always gone to the company address. \\n\\nThe day I closed the office I went up to my Chase branch and spoke to my banking contact XXXX XXXX. I told him I had left and the physical office was closed. I explained that the bookkeeper was taking over. I informed him I was no longer a signatory on checks and she had the card in her possession. \\nSome time in XXXX I contacted XXXX on a personal banking matter and when my leaving was referenced he claimed he had no idea and denied I ever came to see him. Not sure why. Perhaps he genuinely forgot. I asked him if the card needed to be closed. But he was rather argumentative. He said he would take care of it. He contacted XXXX XXXX. That resulted in the following email exchange that you will see below. \\n\\nXXXX, XXXX XXXX had left XXXX XXXX this past XXXX. Please advise on having him removed from these business accounts. Bill can be reached at XXXX. Thank you. \\nRegards, XXXX XXXX At that point XXXX asked me for the book keeper \\'s phone number which I supplied to her. That was the extent of her correspondence. The card was kept open and the bank continued to do business with the corporate entity. I heard nothing back from that point on. There was nothing from her about any liability or action regarding the card. The bank never contacted me, or sent me bills or notices, ( despite their claim to the contrary in the attached XX/XX/XXXX letter to my attorney ). Nor was I informed if the account was closed or kept open, or closed. They had a home address for me, and a telephone number. XXXX XXXX did not contact me after that. As noted, she knew I was gone, and card was left open and the bank continued on doing business with the company, and payments were ongoing for a time after that. \\n\\nThe monthly payments continued to be made by the company and were accepted by the bank. The last one was as of XX/XX/XXXX. At some point the XXXX based owner walked way from his obligations and it appears the card was rendered inactive. ( When I was able to retrieve all the records for the account there was nothing between that XXXX statement and one issued XX/XX/XXXX. ) However the company was never closed. And as of earlier this year there is still a bank account with a balance. However the account has been frozen. \\n\\nMost importantly that correspondence from XXXX XXXX was the last I heard from Chase or anyone about he account, until Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. This was over two years after leaving the company. I received the attached notice, mailed to my home, from XXXX XXXX. I had never received a bill or notice at my home address. \\n\\nI contacted XXXX XXXX by email about it. Her email response : I have looked into the credit card ending in XXXX This credit card is issued in the business name, with your self as personal guarantor. That is why I believe you are getting the communication from XXXX XXXX. The last transaction on the card ( purchase transaction ) is from XX/XX/XXXX, but there were payments made each month until XX/XX/XXXX at which time the payments stopped and a late fee has been charged plus the interested each month. \\n\\n( E-mails are attached ) I further asked her about any signature and a closing date. Her response : I am looking into a documentthere may not be one, as one wasnt needed in XXXX Opened XX/XX/XXXX, there is no closed date listedit is in charged off status She also told me statements were available on line. They were not. I called the bank 3 times and they promised statements within 10 days at my home address. They never came. I was finally able to get them printed at a branch. \\n\\nThe notices continued with XXXX offering to reduce the amount of {$29000.00} to around {$11000.00} and a proposed payment plan. I hired legal representation. My attorney then contacted XXXX and said all correspondence should go to him. He explained our stance that I am not liable and this is corporate debt, and outlined the reasons. At that point XXXX returned the debt to Chase. Chase then responded to my lawyer in correspondence received XX/XX/XXXX. ( Attached ). A summation from my lawyer : Chase finally responded. They claim you are responsible personally because you applied in your name with your SSN. They attached a form showing the information. They also attached an Agreement that says, in its section headed Legal Responsibility that says that the person who applied for the account and gave his/her SSN is responsible. \\nChase closes by pointing out that they may close out the account if it is not paid and then report the debt as forgiven,,, the IRS will expect you to pay income taxes on the amount forgiven, {$29000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThey further claimed in the attached document that \" We kept sending monthly statements to XXXX XXXX XXXX until the account charged off on or about XX/XX/XXXX. \\'\\' This is not true. \\n\\nIn referencing my liability they used my home address in XXXX on XXXX. I never received a bill or notice there during the entire time the account was opened and closed. That address was only used by the collection agency. And my last communication was in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, my attorney sent a letter to the XXXX owner notifying him of the debt. ( Attached ). He has not responded, On XX/XX/XXXX my lawyer called the bank at the number provided on the XX/XX/XXXX correspondence that was sent by the bank after XXXX XXXX returned the debt to the bank. He asked that the IRS debt forgiveness be assigned to XXXX and not me. And said if paid a small amount just to end this and so as not to keep paying him was that possible. They said no to both. They advised him to write to a chase address in Delaware. My Lawyer sent a letter to Chase at the Delaware Address ( attached ) on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. In early XXXX we had not heard from the Delaware office. They finally returned a call to my lawyer on XX/XX/XXXX. The person from Chase said they had not read the letter and further stated he had been told the XX/XX/XXXX letter was valid. My lawyer responded that the letter raised specific questions and we wanted answers to those questions. The representative said he would report back the comments. We have yet to hear back. \\n\\nIn addition to the IRS, this has also been reported to the major credit bureaus. My credit record was excellent until this appeared.',\n",

I have always paid my financial obligations and by Chase slashing my credit limit has severely damaged my credit scores and placed an undue burden on my finances.

Chase slashed my credit limit on or about XXXX XX/XX/2019. I request your assistance to rectify this matter because Chase does not care about the consequences of their thoughtless decisions that in my case has caused an approximate 70 points drop for my credit scores. Chase should explain to your bureau why they approved me in the first place and without notice decided with what I feel is malicious intent and they are in violation of the law. As a citizen and consumer who has followed the law and common courtesy I will continue to pursue justice and notify my government representatives and the news media about Chase Bank Credit.

I have attached of the complaints I filed with the CFPB on XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nChase Card Services did not want to hear any of the family/personal issues I have dealt with over the last 5-6 months ; this issue actually dates back to XX/XX/XXXX when she had her first nervous breakdown and I have been working with my daughter ever since. \\n\\nChase Card Services was very rude and insensitive especially telling me that they can close my accounts for any reason and/or at anytime. My problem with this is first they did not know all of the facts and second, they may have closed the account for the wrong reason. They told me that the system/computers makes the decision and there is nothing they can do and then I asked to speak to a human, a supervisor, who could make a decision after hearing all of the facts ; the supervisor gets on the phone and basically says the same crap about the system and management is free to do whatever they want with the account and the decision is final. I also offered to make a payment if they reopened at least one of the accounts and they refused. \\n\\nThese were life-changing events and I was not able to handle these issues while helping my daughter.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'JP Morgan and Chase reported 3 loans ( $ XXXX, $ XXXX and $ XXXX respectively ) as  cancelled debt, to the IRS on my behalf in XX/XX/XXXX. They sent 1099 \\'s to a non-existent address- one that has NEVER been used or reported by me or my cosigner. The address they used is a splicing of 2 separate addresses in 2 different cities in the same state. This cancellation was done after Chase claims they made multiple attempts to contact my cosigner for repayment, an arguable fact as my cosigner has absolutely no knowledge or paperwork to that affect though Chase has her correct address and phone number ( I have confirmed this through phone calls with Chase ).\\n\\nMy cosigner is a retired account and as such, she keeps every scrap of paper concerning loans and financing she receives and she has no record of the loans Chase reported cancelled-nor do I- so I contacted Chase to request copies of the original loan contracts as proof that the loans are in fact mine. These loans do not show up on either of our credit reports so we are questioning where they came from. \\n\\nMy first phone call to Chase was on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a woman named XXXX in the IRS notice department. She was \" unable to provide further information \\'\\'. Because Chase no longer directly deals with Student Loans, I could not get a direct number into Chase so I contacted our Local Chase bank branch and spoke to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She took my information and sent an internal email in an attempt to either get the information I was seeking or to put me in touch with the people who could. \\n\\nWhen I hadn\\'t heard anything, I reached back out to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She was helping someone else so my call was taken by the branch manager, who took all of my information and filed a grievance on my behalf through Chase \\'s complaint and compliance department. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) with the complaint and compliance department. She said my information had been given to the research team who would look into the loans. When they completed their search, she would be back in touch with what they found. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called me back and said they had located specifics on the loans in question and directed me to the Chase Recovery and loan specialist department, who would then be able to provide the appropriate documentation I was seeking. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the Loan Specialist department and spoke to a woman who confirmed the Loan numbers, amounts and cosigner. I asked why these loans were not showing up on any credit report and she stated that the loans \" drop off as soon as they are cancelled, \\'\\' a statement that is absolutely false. I requested copies of the original loan contracts and she said she would have them sent to me with no issue. The contract was post marked XX/XX/XXXX and arrived XX/XX/XXXX. However, the contract she sent was NOT the correct Loan contract. It was not the correct dates, amount or loan number.\\n\\nRealizing that I wasn\\'t getting anywhere, my cosigner contacted Chase on XX/XX/XXXX attempting to get the information i requested. The man she spoke to again confirmed details but instead of sending contracts, referred her to the IRS for further questions. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, my Cosigner again contacted Chase to directly request contract copies for these loans. On this phone call, she was told she was NOT a cosigner and therefore could not be given any information or sent any contracts. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Chase again and spoke to loan specialist #  XXXX who confirmed that my cosigner was in fact on the loans. She said the original loans were taken out between XXXX. She said loans were charged off XX/XX/XXXX, letters sent in XXXX and reported cancelled in XXXX. This time she Could NOT confirm the address the 1099 \\'s were sent to. She said she had no idea where the address came from ; she also corrected previous information given and confirmed that these loans should be on our credit reports ( she offered to send me to the credit reporting dept to \" fix \\'\\' the non reported loans ; I declined ). She said she had requested copies of the original contracts as well as copies of the 1099 \\'s for these loans, to be sent to me in 7-10 business days. Unfortunately the only documentation she sent were 1099 \\'s with the wrong address. I have STILL yet to receive a single piece of paper relating to these loan contracts.\\n\\nIt has been 2 months, numerous phones calls, and misinformation and I can not get any tangible proof that the loans reported cancelled on my name and social are in fact my loans and my responsibility. I once again called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX and asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge who could give me a definitive answer and send me concrete proof of these loans. I was transferred to a voicemail, left a very specific message with appropriate contact information, and I have yet to receive a phone call back as of XX/XX/XXXX, even though the voicemail greeting specifically states that a callback will take place within 24 business hours.',\n",

The agent blamed me for getting the incorrect course and demanded more money if I wanted the course I requested. Further attempts to get assistance from the company were not successful. I contacted my bank to file a complaint. My bank issued a temporary credit, but later reversed the credit and awarded the money to the tech training company. I hired a lawyer to attempt to resolve the issue, but training company would not issue me the course I requested or give me my money back. I tried to re-open the complaint with my bank, but they told me I had no recourse. I sent a letter to the Executive Office of the bank to register my grievance.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"My mortgage is with Chase. My payments were being made by XXXX XXXX XXXX paying early each month. XXXX was the provider of XXXX to Chase. Evidently, XXXX was sold to XXXX. On XX/XX/2019, XXXX transferred the files and told XXXX that Chase said I was bankrupt and to terminate the processes. XXXX did and did not pay Chase any longer. I have received no communication from anyone on this. I was going to open a checking account at Chase today and noticed that my mortgage had not been paid. I called and they said that XXXX will not pay them and have terminated me to bankruptcy, which I am not in since the mortgage holder would know. After much pain, I was able to get a mortgage verification letter sent to XXXX so they can restart my payments. However, I had to make a complete payment, pay late fees, and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history. \\n\\nXXXX was negligent with the files transfer and XXXX was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered. \\n\\nWhat can be done? I have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me. No one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances. I thought that I am entitled to all records about myself. \\n\\nI am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run. XXXX must have been really evil and XXXX doesn't really read what they are given or even contact the person. XXXX did not let me know they were changing services. \\n\\nI can provide only the mortgage verification from Chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data. They say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed. Evidently, XXXX did not use a human review process to read, only accept checked fields of bad records.\",\n",

On XXXX/XXXX/2019, I immediately opened a dispute in the local Chase branch. At that time, Chase gave me a temporary credit for the charge. A few days later I canceled the card to refrain from my credit card being charged again fraudulently. However, on XXXX/XXXX/19, the unauthorized charge reappeared on my card again. In addition, on XXXX/XXXX/2019, I received a letter from Chase ( written XXXX/XXXX/2019 ) advising that they received verification of the charge. Yet, it was a fraudulent charge that I did not authorize. Therefore, it is impossible for their verification to be accurate, and I should not be held responsible for the charge. Chase has closed the dispute and rebilled the charge amount of {$360.00} to my card plus interest. I am not happy with the way this matter has been handled. As a result, I do not appreciate the security measures that Chase offers in protecting my account from unauthorized usage.',\n",

He left voice mail. \\n2. XX/XX/, 2019 at XXXX XXXX. We spoke briefly and I asked him to call back at noon. \\n3. XXXX XXXX, 2019 at XXXX XXXX. He left voice mail. \\n4. XX/XX/, 2019 at XXXX XXXX. I left voice message for a return call. His voice message indicated a return call within 24 hours. \\n5. XX/XX/, 2019 at XXXX XXXX. I left another voice messsage for return call. \\n\\nDue to not returning my calls and the importance of my issues, I reached out to my representive from XXXX who began making calls to Mr. XXXX on my behalf. I am sure she made notes on the date and time. She left several messages. There was even a little joke on when Mr. XXXX was going to return her call. She said \" watch, he is going to call her when he is about to walk out the door \\'\\'. Later that day, I forgot what day it was, be Mr. XXXX, sure enough, called at XXXX. According to his outgoing voice message, he gets off at XXXX. Having dealt with sneaky tactics by Chase for years, I could only shack my head. \\n\\nAt the time, I needed to speak directly with him. Having worked in an environment where I need to stay on top of clients and files, I know that a supervisor needs to be notified when there is a failure to meet expectations. I expected a phone call to verbally answer questions. I did not get that. Nor did my representative.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Good evening, On XX/XX/2019 I purchased a XXXX XXXX ticket using Chase Ultimate Rewards Points with my Chase Sapphire Reserve Credit card. XXXX XXXX canceled my return flight and issued me a partial refund for {$150.00}. XXXX informed me on XX/XX/2019 that the refund was processed. It's been weeks and Chase refuse to refund my account. \\nI waited the appropriate amount of time for the refund to appear on my account but it never did. I contacted Chase Card services using the secure messages feature and informed them of the issue. Chase told me the refund processed to a different credit card number from the one I have, and that I'd need to work out my refund with the airline. I contacted XXXX again, who informed me that when a customer books a flight with credit card points, the credit card company itself reserves the flight through a partnered travel agency, and that XXXX had reimbursed Chase 's partnered travel agency, because XXXX can only reimburse in the exact method in which the flight was reserved. \\nA XXXX representative told me to contact Chase again and tell the credit card company to reach out to their agency, confirm the {$150.00} reimbursement, and then forward the refund to my account. I messaged Chase on XX/XX/2019 and told them this issue and asked them to confirm my refund with their agency. Chase sent me a repeat semi-automated response to contact XXXX again, and claimed that I hadn't booked the flight using Chase ( even though I definitely booked the flight with Chase Ultimate Rewards Points and I have the email confirmation to prove it ). Chase customer service is sending me in circles, refusing to follow up with their own travel agency, refusing to read the messages I sent them with pertinent information, and refusing to process my refund to my account. I have spent over twenty hours contacting Chase and two months of frustration waiting for my refund. \\nFurthermore, when I spoke to a Chase representative on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX she was less than helpful. She told me XXXX cancelled my return flight because I'd failed to arrive at the airport for my departing flight ( this was false and easily disproved. I'd flown on the departing flight the day before ). She was also unable to receive emails, so I couldn't show her the XXXX flight or refund information. When I learned I could not forward documents to Chase employees while on the phone, I decided to use the secure messaging. But this method of communicating with Chase has proven just as ineffective. \\nI am attaching to this complaint all of my messages with Chase, proof that XXXX processed my refund, and proof that I purchased the flight through Chase.\",\n",

I was told the check would be sent out within seven business days. I never received the check and recontacted Chase via their secure message system on XX/XX/2019 to inquire on the status of my check. I was told again it would take seven business days until a check would be sent out to me, which I responded that I had already waited well past seven business days. I was then told the next day that I needed to physically go into a Chase branch to fill out a for for Declaration of Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Cashier 's Check, and have it notarized. I initially refused because my work schedule does not allow me to easily go to any of Chase 's branches. However, I relented after a few days, due to the stress this situation was causing. After going into the XXXX, Virginia Chase branch on XX/XX/19, I waited for service for about an hour before finally speaking with a representative whose name was XXXX XXXX. XXXX told me I would have to fill out the form, and that I would be able to get a new check that day in the branch. However, after filling out all of the paperwork, I was then told that I could not actually receive a check that day, because I had cancelled the account online, and not in a physical store. This seemed absurd to me since I was physically in a Chase bank, and Chase should be able to cancel their own checks, and write their own checks, or so I thought. Regardless, I left after being told I would have my check overnighted to me most likely by Tuesday ( XX/XX/19 ), and that someone would contact me on Monday ( XX/XX/19) - neither of these things happened. Additionally, I contacted XXXX using the business card she gave me on my trip into the branch on the following Saturday (XX/XX/19 ). Her coworker answered her phone and told me she would be busy all day and would not be able to contact me until Monday. I asked XXXX 's coworked if she could inquire about my check, to which I was told she could not, and that I would have to wait until Monday. At this point, I am very concerned that I will not be receiving my funds, which I have been waiting for for nearly a month since closing my account. I don't know if the incompetency of Chase 's checking/mailing system is something that can be fixed, but I am contemplating getting a lawyer if I do not receive my check by the end of this week. I have spent hours on the phone, writing emails, going into Chase 's branch, etc, all for the purpose of trying to get my money back. This is completely unacceptable and I don't know where else to turn from here.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Hello. My claim refers to two transactions made through XXXX from the bank Chase that ended up in the wrong hands for reasons beyond my control and has resulted in money lost without response. \\nIt happened as explained : I have check accounts with XXXX XXXX and chase. In XXXX XXXX I had XXXX configured with my phone number, with chase XXXX used my email. On XX/XX/XXXX I changed my phone number on XXXX  for scam call harassment. 3 days later XX/XX/XXXX I updated my information on the XXXX XXXX website by putting my new phone number. I made a transaction of XXXX using XXXX from chase as I usually do, using my new number and trusting that everything was fine. The next day XXXX my wife calls me saying there was not enough money in the joint XXXX XXXX account and I send XXXX more and then I verify and surprise : no transaction ever arrived. Quickly from my work center I call chase and XXXX XXXX to get an answer and they tell me that it can not be canceled. \\nI personally went to both banks and they just told me that that phone number was anchored to the previous owner of the number in the XXXX XXXX XXXX.I called XXXX  and they tell me that number had not been used for months.I updated my profile in XXXX XXXX on time, as it was possible that? It turns out that although your data is correctly updated in the profile in the XXXX XXXX system, you can not register that phone in XXXX if it is anchored to another bank. But chase having been informed of the problem to try to give quick solution like cancellation or something, never did anything, and the money was mine and left chase at the wrong hands. I made a claim in Chase with number XXXX, they washed their hands passing the claim to XXXX with number XXXX tried to communicate with the customer service in XXXX and it is  impossible to reach because they always refer you to your banking institution. And I have not even received any answer by email from them just total silence. \\nYesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, after several attempts to recover my money I have called to Chase and they tell me that the back office tried to recover the money from the XXXX  XXXX XXXX and it was not possible. So simple as that.This shows that the XXXX system is not at all safe but also demonstrates the incompetence of a bank as Chase to fairly solve a situation that I was not guilty of, Because simply I did everything I had to do at the time I used my own phone number, update my information as required and so and all the money has been lost. That's why I ask for a refund of my money to Chase, as it should be.\",\n",

I informed the Bank that the account was fraudulently opened in my name and asked that it be closed immediately. I also requested details of how, where, and when the account was opened in my name. The individual that I spoke with refused to provide me with any information regarding the account unless I provided her with my Social Security number. I refused to do this, as I am uncertain what information the Bank has. I requested a supervisor, who also refused to work with me to resolve this issue.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I received an offer from Chase XXXX Visa promising a companion airline pass XXXX bonus points for opening a Chase XXXX Visa card. I applied for the card online in XX/XX/XXXX providing my current email address, phone number and address. I was approved. In XXXX I requested paperless billing statements/correspondence and assumed that my current contact information provided at time of approval would be utilized by Chase for the XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nHaving previous Chase credit card products I was able to log into my online account and setup automatic bill payment for my account. I used my card as needed to earn the companion pass and bonus points and assumed the auto payments were being made from my checking account as I viewed line items that had Chase in the description and as I was not receiving paper statements/emails or phone calls from Chase regarding my XXXX account. \\n\\nIn reviewing my checking account statement in XXXX and realizing the that the Chase line item was actually an auto payment for one of my husbands credit cards and was not in fact for the XXXX Visa card I reached out to Chase XXXX Visa immediately. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to the customer service phone number listed on the back of my card ( Payments are due on the XXXX of the month ) to learn that I was 34 days past due and explained that auto payment had been requested on my end via the online tool which they explained could take 1-2 business cycles but did not appear to have gone into affect. \\n\\nAdditionally, I learned that they did not have the correct contact information in the system but instead had reached out to old email addresses and telephone contact information from previous accounts that had auto populated instead of using the correct information I had provided at the time of application. \\n\\nI made a payment by phone immediately to payoff the entire balance, requested auto payment to be setup and confirmed on their end as well as requested that the current contact information be setup in the system to avoid missing communications in the future. \\n\\nThey made notation in the account of the challenge, reversed all late charges and ensured me that the late payment would not be reported to the credit bureau due to the banking error. Also confirmed that I had met the required spend to earn the bonus and given the banking error, reversal of late charges, payment in full and notation that I would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which I HAVE received. This reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end. \\n\\nAll subsequent payments have been made on time and as of XX/XX/XXXX the account has a {$12.00} balance due to charges made after payment in full. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX alert service that I subscribe to that my credit score had decreased from XXXX to XXXX. I opened the XXXX file which stated a late payment was reported by Chase for XXXX. I filed a dispute and in XXXX received an email from XXXX  stating the dispute had been resolved. Upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed. \\n\\nI contacted Chase XXXX Visa, explained the negative reporting, the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges. They stated that the \" Credit Bureau Unit \\'\\' was not currently open and requested I call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information. \\n\\nI followed the advice and spoke with XXXX, CBU specialist in the XXXX, MO call center. After a long period of discussion XXXX informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau. \\n\\nAfter requesting all notation on my file he advised I send a fax to the \" Business Office \\'\\' at ( XXXX ) XXXX but that there was not a live person to speak with nor an email that I could send the request to. \\n\\nI asked to speak to his supervisor at which point he transferred me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to XXXX customer service. \\n\\nIn speaking with XXXX in customer service I believed that I was still speaking to the Credit Bureau department. I recalled all events, she confirmed the notation in the account. Additionally, I advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on XX/XX/XXXX my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all Chase accounts. I was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account I received a screen that stated that I needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbers/email that were pre-populated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information. I had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once I was able to gain access into the account I confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the DEFAULT contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information. \\n\\nI explained to her that when I tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account. She assisted with updating on her end, had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information. \\n\\nGiven all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup I asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting. At this point SHE ADVISED ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE CREDIT BUREAU DEPARTMENT and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done. I explained that I had already spoken with XXXX in that department and that I was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her. She stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to 5 days to provide a call back. \\n\\nShe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named XXXX, explained the situation and XXXX told her that there \" was nothing that he could do to assist \\'\\'. \\n\\nI have never been late with a payment across all accounts. I have spent numerous hours trying to resolve this matter with JP Morgan Chase/XXXX. As a result of Chase/XXXX XXXX it appears that my diligence to setup auto payment & provide current contact information for my account were not feasible and will now have a significant impact on the cost of credit that I will be seeking for a new home purchase mortgage given that my credit rating went from \" Outstanding \\'\\' to \" Good \\'\\' and is the main tool used by lenders for determining interest rates offered. \\n\\nI am reaching out to you in hopes that you will be able to 1 ) Assist with restoring my credit due to banking/IT error on the part of the credit card issuer 2 ) By sharing my story prevent another person from being lured into getting a credit card from Chase and have to deal with the same challenges I have faced.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I purchased an online e-commerce course in hope of learning an effective way to start an online store. The course was created by a guru named XXXX XXXX, In numerous advertisements for the course, both written and video, XXXX claims that there is a 14 day guaranteed return with no additional requirements. Upon opening and viewing the early parts of the course, I realized that the startup costs are higher than XXXX deemed necessary to start the business in his marketing messages. After about 10 days, I decided to return the course once finding out it resembles a scam and is not a legitimate way to start a business, and went online for more information about returns. Once I visited the XXXX XXXX website, I see a page with a return policy that includes several unreasonable requirements for return. XXXX lists that for a refund, the user must complete a long module in the course within the 14 day period. In addition, the user must submit evidence of their coursework before being considered for a refund. The amount of coursework required was very long and unreasonable for someone who decided they no longer want to keep the course. Given that I am a student and work part time, I was not spending precious time working on a course I no longer had belief in. Under any circumstances other than those listed on the website, the customer support team did not accept returns, even after I emailed them about my situation. I had agreed to a three month payment plan of {$390.00} a month before buying the course. Since I was denied a refund, I ended up having {$390.00} automatically removed from my account on the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I disputed the charges with my bank, Chase, on XX/XX/2019. I explained the situation in a letter and provided print-outs of XXXX XXXX website as evidence of the misleading advertising and unreasonable refund requirements he places on buyers. I also included a heavily supported XXXX post from an Internet user who had a similar experience to mine and viewed XXXX XXXX as a scam after his experience with the course. The bank accepted my argument and refunded me for the {$390.00} withdrawn in XXXX and XXXX. However, they refused to reimburse me for the XXXX payment. The first payment from XXXX was billed to me on XX/XX/2019. According to the bank, since I filed my claim on XX/XX/XXXX, it was 61 days after the first charge and, therefore, the XXXX charge fell out of their 60 day policy for refunds through claims. However, I find it unusual for Chase to agree with a customers evidence about a seedy business practice, and proceed to only partially refund the victim. Regardless of their policy, a transaction that has been considered faulty needs to be reimbursed in full. Chase had already given me a full reimbursement for all three payments in XX/XX/2019. However, a month later they bring up their 60 day policy and make an unauthorized withdrawal of {$390.00} from an account that was linked to mine, which belonged to a relative. My frustration became so high that I immediately proceeded to close my account following their refusal to reimburse me. Following my account closing, Chase apparently believed it was within means to instead remove the money from an individual account with a completely different account holder. My mothers account was not involved in this transaction but was affected regardless, due to Chase overstepping its boundaries and compensating for the {$390.00} from an account that was completely separate from my identity and unrelated to this dispute. My mothers name was not involved at all in my transactions with XXXX XXXX and my name was not on her account. Therefore, this is a very fraudulent and unethical practice, and not a fair, proper way to resolve this issue. It is also perplexing that Chase did not acknowledge this 60 day policy when initially reimbursing me fully and giving me the OK to spend the money. Overall, I am very frustrated with the way Chase has treated two of its former customers, especially given that we became victims of a scam, and intend to take legal action if not reimbursed.',\n",

Chase, in response to the complaint, provided transaction information which we shared with the vendor.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I have a Chase Sapphire Reserved Card, and the payment is due the first of the month. To pay the bill, I can go through the Chase credit card website and it automatically draws the payment from my Bank Account. The payment normally takes several hours to be completed, although they do state that it can take up to two business days. I normally schedule the payment two days in advance of when my payment is due to ensure that it is received on time, taking into account weekends and how many business days there are before the first of the month. \\n\\nI have made payments for this credit card on time for every single month. However, on at least four instances, the credit card is saying payments have been late, and they charge a late fee and interest charge. For the first two instances, I know I made the payments on time, but the company said it was posted late and so they charged fees. When I found out, I called the credit card company and spoke to their customer service representative, and eventually after talking to supervisors they acknowledged that their system inappropriately delayed when the payment was shown as posting, and so they refunded the late fees and interest charged. More recently for this past XXXX, it occurred again. And then for XXXX, I went online and made the payment, but when I got my statement for XXXX recently, it's saying that the payment was never received and so it charged late fees and interested for both XXXX and XXXX. I am tying to talk to them to get them to address these situations as well and am hoping they will resolve it, but it's now seeming to be a pattern. And I have heard from others who have this credit card ( and other credit cards ) that they experience this as well. I don't know if it's just errors in these companies ' systems, or if it is purposeful as a way for them to collect late fees and interest charges from unsuspecting customers. I am lucky in that I am familiar with consumer protections laws and so know how to call them and challenge them, but I worry that many consumers won't notice or won't know how to challenge them and so just pay them. I am wondering if others have complained about this to CFPB and so perhaps it is in fact a pattern that requires investigation? Thank you for your time and consideration, and for all you do to help protect consumers across the country.\",\n",

OnXX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from the End of Lease Department at Chase Auto Finance with my total lease liability, including excess mileage.The excess mileage amount due was $XXXX, which assumed a charge of XXXX cents per excess mile.

I explained to him that my lease stated an excess of XXXX  cents per mile instead of XXXX cents per mile and he said that someone probably made a mistake.The excess mileage amount stated in the lease agreement is XXXX  cents, not XXXX cents. Therefore, the amount owed for excess mileage should be $XXXX. I ask Chase Auto Finance to please honor the written agreement and refund the difference of $XXXXI have tried to remediate this issue with Chase before reaching this point. I called the End of Lease Department at XXXX XXXX several times and I spoke with different people. The first time, onXX/XX/XXXX, I was asked to fax my lease agreement so they could compare it against what they had on their records. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX, and twice on XX/XX/XXXX. In all instances I was told that the agreement stated XXXX cents per mile, and that the amount owed would not be amended. On XX/XX/XXXX I tried to escalate my complaint to a supervisor. I spoke with someone with IDXX/XX/XXXXXXXX, who told me I would get a call back from another supervisor in 72 hours. I asked for a contact number in case I did not hear back and I got a phone number, XXXX XXXX, and a name (XXXX), but they refused to give me a last name. I never received a call back or a voicemail.During one of these calls, I also asked what the due date to pay the amount owed was, because the letter I originally received from Chase just said “Please pay this amount upon receipt of this letter.” I was told that they would close the account after between 120 and 119 days after being open and send it to collections. I asked to get that in writing but they refused several times.I got in touch with XXXX XXXX, Chase Private Client, and XXXX XXXXXXXX, Chase Branch Manager from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA office, who helped escalate the issue with Chase Auto Finance. They first asked me to call XXXX XXXX extension #XXXX and ask for XXXX, who I talked to and got the same response as before. Then they opened a ticket with the Chase Branch Complaint Escalation team, and I got in touch with XXXX (XXXX XXXX   extension #XXXX), who reached out to Chase Auto Finance. They reviewed my case and they stood by their decision of charging me XXXX cents per mile.I then asked XXXX if she could ask Chase Auto Finance to get clarity on the due date. She called them and was told that they could close the account and send it to collections as soon as 30 days after being opened, and again refused to provide written proof.Given the circumstances, I felt threatened to pay the total amount due to protect my credit score.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/XXXX at roughly XXXX, I accidentally left my phone and wallet in an XXXX. When I realized my mistake, I could not contact the XXXX driver because my phone was still in his car. A few hours later I began receiving emails concerning suspicious activity on all of my credit card and debit accounts that I was able to view with my home computer. I froze whatever I could through my laptop, but could not call in to report the calls until Monday morning by using a coworkers phone at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TN XXXX ). All of my credit card disputes were approved relatively quickly, but the fraud division of Chase handling my checking account/debit card dispute denied my claim. They denied it on the basis that I stated I had not written the pin number on the card, but the thief was able to withdraw money without entering an incorrect pin number. \\nThis was a brand new card, I opened the account with them and set up direct deposit because of a promotion that earned me {$300.00} for doing so. I had only used the account on XX/XX/XXXX to pay rent, pay a portion of my Chase credit card, and withdraw {$20.00} with a {$2.00} withdrawal fee. I do not recall setting up a pin with this card because I only used it once, but if I had set up a pin, it would have been XXXX. This number is present in my email address ( admittedly a poor decision on my part ) and the thief had access to my phone which had my email logged into it. This is my best guess at how they could access my checking account via my debit card. They withdrew roughly {$1000.00} while I had roughly {$1400.00} total in the account intended to cover an upcoming rent charge ( about {$1300.00} ) and when the rent charge went through on XX/XX/XXXX, it over-drafted my account. The rent money was returned by my apartment with the exception of a {$35.00} insufficient fund return fee, but my account was only returned to positive {$550.00} ( {$200.00} difference between my rent charge and the money they withdrew plus {$300.00} from the account opening incentive bonus ). I arrived at work on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX Central Time while I was still receiving emails from chase that my account had been overdrafted just an hour before at XXXX Central Time and other credit cards of mine that were stolen in the same wallet were showing activity out of state ( Indiana , Wisconsin ) while I was badged in to the gated property I work at ( XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , Tn XXXX ). \\n\\nChase Claim Numbers : XXXX XXXX To summarize : The Chase Fraud Department associated with personal checking accounts denied my fraud claims associated with my now closed chase checking acount ( ending in XXXX ) resulting in me losing roughly {$1000.00}. \\n\\nNote : In the email i included entitled \" Phone Claim, \\'\\' it addresses me as XXXX. This is because I am on my family \\'s phone plan, and the XXXX account and insurance is in my father XXXX \\'s name. I am including this to prove that my phone was stolen and that I used insurance to replace it.',\n",

The email on the order is not my email, the phone number is not my phone number or any other connection to myself. I made a police report within the city I reside in and I provided Chase Amazon Visa the police report and I asked them to re-open the case since they had false information of the order being placed by myself. I was provided a letter after and said they found no evidence of fraudulent charges and I would be responsible for the charges. When asking what they are basing their decision on and to provide me in writing of their conclusion, I was told they can not do that.

United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 731 ( 1931 ) ; see also Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 188 ( 1824 ). Normal meaning may of course include an idiomatic meaning, but it excludes secret or technical meanings that would not have been known to ordinary citizens in the founding generation. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 ( 2008 ).\\n\\nOBLIGATIONS : In common language, the state of California articulates the predicate for an obligation by stating the following : CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE CCP PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS ( Preliminary Provisions enacted 1872. ) 26. Section Twenty-Six. An obligation is a legal duty, by which one person is bound to do or not to do a certain thing, and arises from : One- Contract ; or Two- Operation of law.\\n\\n( Amended by Code Amendments 1873 -74, Ch. 383 ) COMMON LANGUAGE : The State of  California clarifies the meaning of the terms Contract or by Operation of Law with the following : CIVIL CODE CIV DIVISION 3. OBLIGAGTIONS PART 1. OBLIGATIONS IN GENERAL TITLE 1. DEFINITION OF OBLIGATIONS 1427. An obligation is a legal duty, by which a person is bound to do or not to do a certain thing.\\n\\n1428. Section Fourteen Hundred and Twenty-Eight. An obligation arises either from : One The contract of the parties ; or, Two The operation of law. An obligation arising from operation of law may be enforced in the manner provided by law, or by civil action or proceeding.\\n\\n( Amended by Code Amendments 1872 74, Ch. 612. ) A CONTEMPORANEOUS REVIEW OF  EVENTS It was XX/XX/XXXX, when my wife and I first made the acquaintance of Mrs. XXXX XXXX as a JP Morgan Chase, XXXX Home Lending Advisor NMLS ID XXXX, at the XXXX, CA branch where she introduced herself and represented that she has a 10-years tenure with JP Morgan Chase as a Home Lending Advisor. \\n\\nAs the more knowledgeable person, my wife engaged the financial details of the prospective Refinancing details of the conversation with Mrs. XXXX XXXX, articulating : 1. My wife shared with Ms. XXXX that she believed my Credit Score should be in the range of 700 720. \\n2. We disclosed that we did NOT want to take any cash out of the property.\\n\\n3. We also shared with her that we would be paying out of pocket the refinancing cost so please do not wrap any cost into the Loan. \\n4. We asked how long is Chases Refinance process and Ms. XXXX share 45 to 60 days. We asked whether or not if she could complete the process in 30 days since we would not be taking any cash out. She committed to completing the process in 30 days if we were able to forward all of the documents on the list she provided back to her on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. We committed to going home and forwarding to her all of the documents requested on Saturday, XXXX XXXX. \\n5. Ms. XXXX represented that we would not have to do an appraisal since XXXX XXXX the property at ; $ XXXX. \\n\\nMrs. XXXX XXXX further represented : 1. After we provided Ms. XXXX with a copy of our current Mortgage Statement. She completed her Calculation using the automated Mortgage Calculator on her desktop, using a Credit Score of XXXX then changing it to XXXX points. The calculation provided an Interest Rate of 3.87 %. \\n2. Ms. XXXX never disclosed to my wife and I that we would have to provide a Good Faith Fee of {$500.00}. \\n\\nAgain, my wife represented to Mrs. XXXX XXXX at the conclusion of the XX/XX/XXXX, meeting that she would immediately send over the requested loan documents as soon as we arrived home, which, Mrs. XXXX appeared to acknowledge in affirmation since it was before XXXX Oclock XXXX. \\n\\nITENARY OF ACTIVITY My wife sent over all of the documents to Ms. XXXX XXXX as represented as expeditiously upon arrival to home at approximately XXXX XXXX per the e-mail dated XX/XX/XXXX. \\nReply e-mail from Ms. XXXX indicated that she was gone for the day XX/XX/XXXX and would not return to the office until Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. Hello, I am out of office for the remainder of the day. I will however respond to emails Tuesday. For urgent matters reach out to the client care specialist assigned to your loan. Thank you and have a blessed day. Thank you for choosing Chase! \\nWhen we did not her from Ms. XXXX on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, my wife called her late Tuesday afternoon. XXXX represented that she never received the documents even though here email reply when documents were sent stated the above message. \\nMy wife asked XXXX to look into her Spam/Junk Box. That is when she confirmed she had the documents and that she would prepare the Loan Application. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX Ms. XXXX XXXX remits e-mail correspondence articulating the following : Hello, Hope all is well. \\nYour loan application is ready. Please connect with me once you review them. The rate was higher due to the credit coming in a little lower, [ Fico Scores, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, respectively ], but I will reach out to my management if there is anything we can do. \\n\\nOne item was missing, the home owners declaration page. \\n\\nPlease send that last item as well. \\n\\nRegards, XXXX If you are not 100 % satisfied with my service or your experience with Chase at any time, please let me or my manager know right away. Our contact information is below. \\n\\nThank you for choosing Chase. \\n\\nMy wife and I sent e-mail correspondence to Ms. XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, stating : Hi XXXX : Below you state, the rate was higher due to the credit coming in a little lower. What is the Fico Score? What is the Rate you are now quoting on the application? \\n\\nWhat is Chase fee on buying down Points, would you kindly itemize them out so that me and my wife can review? \\n\\nWhat does your statement below mean where you state, but I will reach out to my management if there is anything we can do? \\n\\nLastly, the no-reply @ mail-chasemortgage email link for me to sign-up does not work! Also, if it did work, I would be unable to complete the application due to the fact that you DID NOT provide me with a Loan Application Number. We would like to complete this process within 30 days, which you stated that you would be able to make that work but I cant begin the process without a Loan Application Number as well as knowing what Rate you are now quoting and what my Fico Score is coming back at. Can you provide a copy of the credit report so that I can review it for discrepancies? \\n\\nI, We, look forward to your quick response. \\n\\nBest regards, XXXX XXXX and wife XXXX. \\n\\nLater in the afternoon of Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX  EDT, Ms. XXXX XXXX remitted a reply e-mail in response to the Joint e-mail of my wife and I, sent at XXXX XXXX, by stating the following : Hello, I hope all is well. \\n\\nSo, for starters, the information you requested, the credit score range : XXXX  XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nYour mortgage loan number is XXXX. This should help with the portal and reviewing the loan application disclosures. \\n\\nFor now, the rate we have 4.125 %, APR 4.161 % Total cost of loan {$2200.00}, and we are not in need of an appraisal. With the proposed figures your payment will be {$2500.00} decreasing {$290.00}, and eliminating your mortgage insurance. \\n\\nBuy down the points are the following : 4.00 %, APR 4.0330 %, cost {$3700.00} ( payment {$2500.00} ) 3.875 %, APR 3.9430 %, cost {$5300.00} ( payment {$2500.00} ). \\n\\nLet me know your thoughts, and XXXX you can call me this evening when your home and we can talk and go thru the application over the phone if you like. \\nIf you are not 100 % satisfied with my service or your experience with Chase at any time, please let me or my manager know right away. Our contact information is below. Thank you for choosing Chase. \\n\\n\\nWHAT IS DECEPTION This communication portends several issues from my perspective ; first there is a matter of dubious candor as articulated in the plain language of California CIV 1709 1710, which articulate the following : CIVIL CODE-CIV DIVISION 3. OBLIGATIONS [ 1427 -3272.9 ] ( Heading of Division 3 amended by Stats. 1988. Ch. 160, Sec 14 ) Part 3. OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY LAW [ 1708 1725 ] ( Part 3 enacted 1872. ) 1709. One, who willfully deceives  another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers. \\n1710. A deceit, within the meaning of the last section, is either : 1. The suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true ; 2. The assertion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true ; 3. The suppression of a fact, by one who is bound to disclose it, or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact ; or, 4. A promise, made without any intention of performing it.\\n\\n( enacted 1872 ) BACK AND FORTH BANTERING : Emails dispersed from myself to Ms. XXXX XXXX and my wife to Ms. XXXX XXXX, [ cc and her supervisor, Mr. XXXX XXXX eventually, Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX ] from the period of XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX indicate a pattern of deception enumerated in CIV 1710 ( 1 4 ) and may concurrently be in contravention of GOV 12927 ( c ) ( 1 ), which articulates the following narrative in part : GOVERNMENT CODE - GOV TLE 2. GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [ 8000 - 22980 ] ( Title 2 enacted by Stats. 1943, Ch. 134. ) DIVISION 3. EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT [ 11000 - 15986 ] ( Division 3 added by Stats. 1945, Ch. 111. ) PART 2.8. DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING [ 1290012996 ] ( Part 2.8 added by Stats. 1980, Ch. 992. ) CHAPTER4.Definitions [ 12925-12928 ] ( Chapter 4 added by Stats. 1980, Ch. 992. ) 12927. As used in this part in connection with housing accommodations, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context : ( c ) ( 1 ) Discrimination *** includes provision  of inferior terms, conditions, privileges, facilities, or services in connection with those housing accommodations. \\n\\n( d ) Housing accommodation means any building, structure, or portion thereof that is occupied as, or intended for occupancy as, a residence by XXXX or more families and any vacant land that is offered for sale or lease for the construction thereon of any building, structure, or portion thereof intended to be so occupied. \\n\\n( f ) Person includes all individuals and entities that are described in Section 3602 ( d ) of Title 42 of the United States Code, and in the definition of owner in subdivision ( e ) of this section, and all institutional third parties, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.\\n\\n( g ) Aggrieved person includes any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or believes that the person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.\\n\\n( h ) Real estate-related transactions include any of the following : ( 1 ) The making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance that is for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling, or that is secured by residential real estate.\\n\\n( 2 ) The selling, brokering, or appraising of residential real property.\\n\\n15 U.S. Code 1639. Requirements for certain mortgages : ( a ) Disclosures ( 1 ) Specific disclosures in addition to other disclosures required under this subchapter, for each mortgage referred to in section 1602 ( aa ) [ 1 ] of this title, the creditor shall provide the following disclosures in conspicuous type size : ( A ) You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application.\\n\\n( o ) Affiliate defined for purposes of this section ; the term affiliate has the same meaning as in section 1841 ( k ) of title 12.\\n\\n( 1 ) Exemptions the Bureau may, by regulation or order, exempt specific mortgage products or categories of mortgages from any or all of the prohibitions specified in subsections ( c ) through ( i ), if the Bureau finds that the exemption ( A ) is in the interest of the borrowing public ; and ( B ) will apply only to products that maintain and strengthen home ownership and equity protection.\\n\\n( 2 ) Prohibitions : The Bureau, by regulation or order, shall prohibit acts or practices in connection with ( A ) mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be unfair, deceptive, or designed to evade the provisions of this section ; and ( B ) refinancing of mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be associated with abusive lending practices, or that are otherwise not in the interest of the borrower.\\n\\nThe sole and exclusive disclaimer made by the agents of Chase, which appears to countervails 15 U.S. C. 1639 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) is the following statement : Ms. XXXX as an Agent for JP Morgan Chase lied when she stated to me and my wife that : 1. JP Morgan Chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering Loan Terms and Interest Rate to me and my wife. \\n\\n2. She lied when she presented to me and my wife that JP Morgan Chase selection of the lowest Fico Score was due to Chases Guideline ( s ) /Policy. \\n\\n3. When we asked for a copy of Chases Guidelines, she and her Manager, Mr. XXXX lied when they stated that JP Morgan Chase Guidelines are Internal documents and are not given out. \\n\\n4. When Ms. XXXX tried to cover Ms. XXXX lie. XXXX XXXX instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written Quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because Chase does meet their Competitors Pricing and Interest Rate. However, when we submitted a written Quote from a competitor, Mr. XXXX in support of Ms. XXXX stated in an email communication that Chase DOES NOT meet competitors pricing and since we had NOT provided a {$500.00} Good Faith Fee and did not submit all documentation [ which we did ] we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the XXXX Fico Score and Pricing or cancel the process. \\n\\n5. Ms. XXXX email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors Pricing/Interest Rate using a XXXX Fico Score as Ms. XXXX instructed us to do with the words, where did you get this from. Never addressing that fact that the Interest Rate quoted was 3.625 % and we did what she asked of us.\\n\\n6. Ms. XXXX was asked NOT to load ANY of the cost into the Loan. She did it anyway and when asked several times to update the Loan Amount she did not complete that task until Friday, XXXX XXXX evening when she was on her way out the door for the week. \\n\\n7. Ms. XXXX lied when she sent me the initial MyHomeChase email to login and/or create login credentials in order to begin the process. Ms. XXXX FAILED to provide me with the Loan Application Number. When my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the 24 hours account creation expired, Ms. XXXX stated that she did not provide the Loan Application Number because she wanted me to give her a call when I discovered that I could not move forward. \\n\\n8. It was during my wife phone conference with Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX that he confirmed the lies that Ms. XXXX represented on behalf of Chase. It was disclosed that Chase DOES uses the Middle Fico Score not the lowest. It was also disclosed that Chase did not have any such Guideline ( s ) /Policy of using the lowest Fico Score as previously represented to us by Ms. XXXX XXXX It was disclosed that Ms. XXXX did NOT 10 years of experience as a Home Loan Advisor with Chase. Mr. XXXX further confirmed that Ms. XXXX has worked for Chase for several years as a Teller along with assisting other Loan Advisors. I believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that Ms. XXXX has worked on ALONE. \\n\\nMr. XXXX in Good Faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to Chases XXXX location, but my wife decided to give Ms. XXXX the benefit-of-the doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process. \\nI believe Mr. XXXX XXXX stated to my wife that he had a conversation with Ms. XXXX regarding the issues. \\n\\nHowever, it was a BIG MISTAKE to leave Ms. XXXX in place. It also appears that the conversation that Mr. XXXX had with Ms. XXXX DID NOT WORK! \\nThroughout Friday, XX/XX/XXXX late afternoon Ms. XXXX sent me several misleading emails informing me that my Loan Documents were ready for me to login to MyHomeChase to complete the loan application process and to paid the {$500.00} Good Faith Fee. \\n\\nI emailed her to alert her that the documents had NOT been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents. She then sent me another email late Friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents. I waited for I believe 2 hours and I emailed her back to share with her that I had not received the separate email. Later in the afternoon/early evening my wife placed a call to her. Her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nShortly, after that the separate email arrived. I login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the OLD documents. I email Ms. XXXX back with both Mr. XXXX & Mr. XXXX on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting Ms. XXXX with hanging the revised documents. Neither Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX responded. \\n\\nHowever, Ms. XXXX did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on Monday and that the only thing she did was to change the Loan Amount. \\nShe went on to let me know that Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nIn conclusion, as far as I am concerned ALL of the above behavior is a clear representation of Unfair Business Practices and Fraudulent Business Practices which my last email on Friday, XXXX XXXX that Mr. XXXX responded back to and forward to his Executive Office clearly reflects my DISDAINED for being subjected to [ 2 Trusted Agents of JP Morgan Chase ], Ms. XXXX and Mr. XXXX Fraudulent and Unlawful Conduct.',\n",

My car payment due is {$270.00} each month, if I submit a payment for {$170.00}, that payment does NOT get applied to the balance whatsoever. It will STILL reflect an amount of {$270.00}, instead of {$100.00} thats is owed, which is misleading and completely not fair. \\n\\nIt leads me to not know exactly how much is due after processing payments because even under recent activity, it does not show the past payments Ive made on the account. Only payments Ive made months prior show up and not recent made payments. \\n\\nIts not fair Chase does not apply the amounts Ive paid to my car to help show the right balance due on my car, this purposely misleads customers like me and we end up being penalized for not paying when weve processed multiple payments to our loan. \\n\\nI should have not been reported late 30 days for a past due balance of {$30.00} when I had made those payments and if chase updated the balances correctly customers such as myself would not have been reported late. \\n\\nIm kindly asking for chase to review and kindly update my credit report to reflect good standing due to bank errors that dont seem to get resolved.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I am a Chase customer since XXXX. I own 2 chase credit cards and I use the checking account to deposit my paychecks every two weeks since past 1 year now. I recently experienced major inconvenience from the Credit Card Fraud department and the Credit Card Dispute Department. \\n\\nBriefly summarizing my case, I booked a flight ticket on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1400.00} from my Chase Freedom Unlimited card..I was about to check-in for the flight on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX to XXXX XXXX, when I get to know that the ticket was no longer valid as the transaction was cancelled by the bank. \\n\\nI went to my nearest Chase bank and the banker named XXXX XXXX tried helping me out with the problem by making a few calls. After being on the call for about 3 hours, we get to learn that someone from the fraud department marked the transaction as fraud and it was then cancelled. Firstly, I never reported the transaction as fraud and I didn't receive any message/call/notification about this from the bank, asking me whether I made the transaction or not. Secondly, I didn't even receive any refund back for 2 months until I called and asked them about it. There was no way for me to know about this incident, except the day before boarding the flight. I had no other option than to book another flight which of course was at a much higher price of {$2200.00}. \\n\\nSo, after 3 months since I first booked the ticket and many long hours of back and forth calls between the 2 departments, I finally did get the {$1400.00} back as a refund, which I appreciate. But I really feel that none of this was my mistake as a transaction was cancelled without even my consent or letting me know in advance. So why should I be bearing a loss of {$800.00}? I don't think it's right to just cancel transactions from a card by marking them fraud without first talking to the customer about it. \\n\\nI e-mailed the same to the CEO, Mr. XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX and received a call back from his department. After reviewing my case and going through the details, I was refused any compensation saying that the bank has the right to cancel any transaction they want, whenever they want. This makes me feel less reliable on Chase credit cards now and I feel it's not the right way to treat the customers. I already cancelled one of the card and stopped depositing my paychecks. Thanks to this unsatisfactory experience. I think more people should hear about my story and be more cautious before using Chase Cards for important transactions.\",\n",

In XXXX I have applied for a credit card with Chase bank and they informed me that they will not approve me because they put my name in their black list and they don't want to do a business with me.  In XXXX I have opened my business checking account with Chase and I am getting rental incomes to that account every month.  Last month my banker advised me to apply for a business credit card account.  They requested for a call and a representative from Chase asked me so many questions for about 30 minutes and I got finally approved for a credit card with Chase bank.  I have started to use it and today I got a letter from them which says that they are closing my account for previous unsatisfactory relationship with Chase.  I have called they and their representative informed me that he can not do anything and I am on their back list again.  I have excellent credit history since XXXX and I have a lots of money in the same bank checking account for several years.

I currently have extremely good credit and by all standards should easily be approved for the card. The bankruptcy which is over seven years old is the only derogatory mark on my entire credit record and I have multiple credit accounts that have never had a problem since my bankruptcy. I have been on Social Security XXXX for many years and am a XXXX veteran. our combined income is currently about $ XXXX/yr. My bankruptcy was caused primarily due to medical reasons possibly related to my military service and my house in Nevada was under water at the time. To prevent the loss of my house it was necessary to declare bankruptcy. I was probably one of the first recipients of a government HAMP mortgage which ended up saving our home. I have never even missed a mortgage payment. Student loans were included in the bankruptcy and the federal bankruptcy judge after presenting my case over a year and a half of submitting proof of my XXXX ruled that I was considered Totally and Permanently XXXX under the XXXX and the student loans were discharged. I have also been ruled as XXXX by a NJ XXXX XXXX judge in court after being examined by their doctor and the US Department of Education.

However, when we got the statement that was not the case. I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX and was told by XXXX that they would listen to the recording of the XX/XX/XXXX call and get back to me.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I am appalled at this situation with Chase. I have spent over 3 months now trying to get this issue resolved. At this point, I\\'ve exhausted my options to resolve the issue on my own, and Chase has not done anything to facilitate the issue. \\n\\nMy Chase checking account had three fraudulent actions. On XX/XX/XXXX there were two credit transactions for {$0.00} and {$0.00} with description XXXX XXXX TRIALCREDT. On XX/XX/XXXX there was a debit of {$900.00} with description XXXX XXXXT NEWACCOUNT. \\n\\nWe were on vacation that week, and weren\\'t actively monitoring our transactions. We were on a XXXX XXXX out of XXXX XXXX, we departed on XX/XX/XXXX and returned on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, we were reviewing our finances on XXXX and noticed these three charges. At first I contacted XXXX to see if they had an account opened in my name - maybe I made a mistake and didn\\'t recognize the charge/account. They had no accounts opened under myself or my wife, so said I needed to work with my own bank \\'s fraud department so that they can resolve. I contacted Chase to alert them that these were unauthorized, fraudulent charges. I was told it would be taken care of without issue, and a temporary credit would be issued for the {$900.00}. I explained my thesis - the two credits were done to \" verify \\'\\' the account at XXXX, and once done they were able to deduct the {$900.00}. Later on, I was told I was absolutely correct. \\n\\nOn about XXXX ( there\\'s no notice or letter on the site, but Chase can verify the date ), I received a letter in the mail stating that my \" claim \\'\\' was denied and the {$900.00} was going to be removed from my account. I immediately called Chase to ask why, and they indicated they had not received the letter back ( attached ) which required : - Review the transactions you are disputing and thoroughly answer all of the questions, - Sign the form, and - Return it by the date above to avoid a delay or denial of temporary credit. \\n\\nI told them that I had not received the letter, or maybe I overlooked it as an account disclosure as it wasn\\'t obvious to me that I needed to do anything further after initially reporting the fraudulent charges. I went to the bank branch to expedite the process of getting the forms signed, and the banker said she faxed the forms. I sent them back the signed forms and a separate letter detailing what had occurred ( I don\\'t have a copy of it, but it\\'s basically everything I\\'ve written so far ). Part of their denial was related to the two \" credit \\'\\' transactions which they had not included in the original claim. I said I had noted that those were fraudulent previously. \\n\\nI called about a week later and they said that the original claim was still denied. I asked if they had received the signed letter, to which they replied \" no \\'\\'. I went back to the bank branch and signed the form again. I took the form and faxed it along with my explanation letter on ~XXXX, which they then opened a new claim for the two \" credit \\'\\' transactions. The \" credit \\'\\' transactions of {$0.00} total were removed from my account. \\n\\nThere have been numerous phone calls to Chase in between looking for status updates, and it basically went unreviewed for about a month. In the process Chase indicated there\\'s a 60 day window to request funds back from a merchant. I said I reported it within that time to Chase. I pleaded with them to call XXXX XXXX - they said they can\\'t make outgoing phone calls. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? After about a month, one time when I called again and they said that the {$900.00} claim was denied because the \" courtesy credit \\'\\' was submitted late because they didn\\'t have the forms ( although they reopened as a courtesy to me on XXXX ), but that the merchant denied after two separate requests. \\n\\nTHEY LIED. They said I would need to reach out to \" the merchant \\'\\' - WHICH IS A BANK. I called XXXX direct again and explained my situation. They couldn\\'t be kinder and more understanding. They again verified that they don\\'t have accounts opened in my or my wife \\'s name. However, I explained the situation and their Fraud department looked up the transaction using my Chase account number and the amounts. The agent validated that the account those funds had gone and come from, and the account had been flagged as fraudulent and frozen. They say saw the \" trialcredits \\'\\' were sent back to their institution, but that THERE WAS NO RECORD OF THE {$900.00} BEING CLAIMED BY CHASE AS FRAUD. They said the money is sitting in the account at XXXX, and Chase just needs to submit the claim and they\\'ll return as a regulatory requirement. They\\'ll honor those requests for up to a year! So after further questions to Chase, it turns out my \" requests were denied \\'\\' by Chase \\'s RESEARCH DEPARTMENT, NOT THE MERCHANT ( HENCE THE LIE )! I\\'ve given more than enough information to explain the situation, and they took forever to basically ignore. \\n\\nI called Chase back and they said they\\'d escalate again given the circumstances. I called on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX and they said I could call back in 3-5 business days to see if there\\'s a resolution. They don\\'t have the courtesy or ability to call me! I called on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX and they said \" did a supervisor call you? \\'\\' to which I replied \" No, they said I needed to call to get an update \\'\\'. They replied \" well it will take 3-5 business days, so try back later \\'\\'. \\n\\nHere \\'s the deal - I had three fraudulent transactions that I reported to Chase in less than two months after occurring. They HAVE NOT CLAIMED THE FUNDS even though they were unauthorized, fraudulent charges. I\\'ve spent countless hours on the phone explaining the case, providing information, even contacting the other bank who told me what Chase needed to do. In the end, this feels like I\\'m being taken advantage from as I am the one liable for the unauthorized ACH transaction. I\\'m pretty sure there\\'s a regulatory requirement against that.',\n",

After I was turned down the first time, I have reapplied within minutes thinking that it might have been a processing glitch, I was turned down for a second time. I have applied today, XX/XX/19, and was turned down for a third time. The first two applications were submitted in XX/XX/19 and I have received two letters from Chase explaining the reason for the denial both of which are dated XX/XX/19. It is because of these letters I am filing this complaint today after getting turned down for a third time, for which I am sure I will receive a letter. On each letter, whose copies I will share with you, my calculated credit score appears as XXXX out of XXXX and this calculation is reported by XXXX. There are 3 factors listed as being the reasons why my application is turned down : 1. Two many recently opened accounts 2. Length of time since most recent bankcard account has been established is too short 3. Not enough debt experience The first two negative factors have low impact on credit scores. The third one is the source of confusion in that if I did not have enough debt experience, how could I possibly have a score of XXXX? \\nAll in all, these reasons do not mesh well with my credit score and my general financial viability which leads me to believe that they were thrown together to make a case which they fail at. \\nThe only reason for this complaint today is to understand why I was really turned down - need plausible reasons because this is likely to cause me trouble. With my financial background I should not experience anything like this. I would be able to rectify whatever is causing this outcome once I know why it is happening. \\nOn a final note, the last credit report I got from XXXX ( I am a customer of their monitoring service ) for all XXXX bureaus list my scores as XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. My XXXX score today is XXXX. If there is a blemish on my record elsewhere, I need to know about it since it should not be there.',\n",

Each time i tried to tell the rep that none of the multiple choice answers they are providing to me as the answers had any significance to me.

Just so i would purposely fail the identity verification and throw my account into suspense and trigger the financial review so they can close the account? Thats not fair. Im XXXX XXXX XXXX and i suffer from XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. This is only adding to my XXXX XXXX.

While reviewing my checking account i found several unauthorized transactions that took place at chase atms XX/XX/XXXX thru the XXXX of XXXX while XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX. I noticed my card was not in my wallet and that it was found in my top dresser drawer around XX/XX/XXXX. I just recently started using online banking. As I am reviewing my statements I am finding issues that I am afraid to even bring up because now im forced to file these disputes because someone spent alot of money out of my checking and savings accounts and now im forced to rely on the credit cards until we work this out but Chase is freezing and closing those accounts. What am i supposed to do? atleast reinstate my XXXX XXXX XXXX with a lower credit limit as im waiting on working with chase now with my checking and savings accounts that someone took the liberty of clearing out while XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX.. why wasnt chase red flagging those transactions whwn transfers were being made from my savings to my checking account when since XXXX they never saw any indication of binge money spending like this..what because its not their money but the credit cards are? this is unfair and i need some justice here.',\n",

I called Chase bank to make a fraudulent report of the purchased item since it was not purchased or authorized by me. Additionally, I called XXXX the seller 's carrier to make a report of the same item. Chase bank went ahead and canceled my Chase bank card which number was ending in XXXX while the matter was been investigated. XXXX simultaneously sent an acknowledgment letter to me stating that the matter was being followed up with a note to the seller in order to return the item. While waiting for the matter to be resolved, I received an online invoice or statement on or about XX/XX/XXXX, stating that there was an additional purchase made on the XXXX 's account that was canceled about 10 days ago, while I am in expectation of the new Chase Bank card in the mail.I spoke with Chase representatives several times and assumed that because I have my bank account on file that shows sufficient amount to pay off in surplus this fraudulent debt, they refused to listen to me and requested each time that I make a payment with my account on the Chase bank system. The irony was that I did not receive any card from Chase bank to replace the canceled card, neither did I activate it. Chase bank has destroyed my credit record and now I cant buy or sell\",\n",

I stated I believed that there must be some type of mistake that they either had my income wrong or debt wrong, because I know my credit score is in the upper 700 's, I only have one other credit card with a larger limit, but paid in full monthly and a house payment. I know my debt to income ratio is 21 % and I have been in the same line of work for over 20 years. I happen to be a XXXX  XXXX and know there is no business reason that I would be denied, so there had to be an error somewhere in the application process. I said I assumed they were double counting my mortgage as I had recently refinanced and they could easily be double counting. The lady wouldn't respond in any way. I asked to speak to a loan officer or supervisor to try and resolve any possible issue and was asked if I didn't mind being called back and I replied that was fine. She said I would receive a call within the next 90 minutes and verified my phone number. I have never received a call back. I've been a customer of Chase in the past and all my accounts and all were handled as agreed. I've never missed or been late on a payment in my life. I understand if there was an error on my application, but the fact they wouldn't, wont, and haven't allowed me to address the issue, even after repeated attempts is a major problem. It is either a problem or they are discriminating.\",\n",

The charge was for two 1-way airline tickets from XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, scheduled for XXXX. On XXXX, I received notice from XXXX XXXX that this flight had been canceled and that a refund \" voucher \\'\\' was offered. As this flight was canceled by XXXX XXXX, not me, a full refund to my charge card is allowed by XXXX law and US law ( Fair Credit Billing Act 1974 ). \\nOn XXXX, Chase Visa requested additional information concerning the dispute. On XXXX, I provided copies of the XXXX XXXX email stating they canceled the flight ; copies of my attempts to contact XXXX XXXX for a refund ; a chronology of all communications with Air XXXX ; and a clearly stated summary noting that I did not cancel this flight. XXXX XXXX replied to the dispute that I canceled the flight ( no proof given, just the statement ) and this was a \" non-refundable \\'\\' ticket so not eligible for a refund. Chase agreed and said the charges were valid, even though they had written proof I did not cancel this flight. \\nI re-disputed these findings on XXXX providing yet more information and emails from XXXX XXXX showing I did not cancel the flight. Again, on XXXX, Chase Visa replied that, \" While you may have a valid complaint with the merchant, the results of our additional review confirm that the transactions are valid and no billing error occurred on your account. \\'\\' I contacted Chase Visa Disputes department and was told that there were no \" errors \\'\\' in my billings. The agent also said this was evaluated as a \" billing error \\'\\' dispute, not a \" merchant did not perform contracted services \\'\\' dispute. She continued to say that there was nothing more that could be done since I had re-disputed these charges, but if I wanted, i could resubmit all my data again and possibly it would be reviewed. \\n\\nI don\\'t understand how this is a valid charge against my account and that Chase Visa has sided with a merchant that clearly has committed fraud, at their own acknowledgment. What can a consumer do in these cases where Chase Visa chooses to blatantly ignore the facts, written proof, and charged the account? Where can I get help? \\nThank you, XXXX XXXX',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'In regards to XXXX & Chase Card Services : Can someone tell me what\\'s the point of having this company as travel insurance? From my understanding the point of travel insurance is to protect a travel purchase/investment from an unforeseen issue. Well if that\\'s the case please ditch this company and find someone more reliable who will step in and actually pay you back your lost investment when things get messy or out of hand between other vendors and third parties.This is an absolute scam, a disservice to the customers they\\'re supposedly serving, and puts the insurance industry in a more negative light than it already is in. \\n\\nI advised on XXXX / XXXX XXXX XXXX about a trip cancellation request in regards to a medical issue and proceeded as expected : I uploaded medical documents, made notations of my fare, and provided all necessary correspondence between the travel agent ( FlightsMojo ) and the common carrier ( SQ ). XXXX then suggested I reach out to both the airline and travel agent and request what documentation is needed. Both parties said differing statements and both can hardly speak a lick of English. And why am I reaching out? I\\'M LITERALLY DOING YOUR WORK FOR YOU. THIS IS YOUR JOB NOT MINE! \\n\\nThe problem only got much worse when XXXX repeatedly asked for an updated medical document from my physician \\'s office to which I complied. And then they asked for an updated medical document with a fancy signature and a stamp ... and another one with nicer handwriting.. to the point where they were just beating around the bush to hope the situation drops. It\\'s clear to see they  don\\'t want to comply with the situation because they would be losing money on the ticket sale hence the repeated use of asking for new medical documentation. \\n\\nXXXX \\'s clause of \" Did you attempt to reach out for refunds or credits? \\'\\' is an absolute joke because clearly I did and have provided the documents ad nauseum but the third party here is avoiding the situation to not lose their profit. This travel insurer should\\'ve stepped in and solved the issue directly by providing a refund for the airfare based on the travel agent \\'s reluctance to cooperate given the excessive requests. When the claims examiner makes useless statements like \" ... after all sir we are just a secondary travel insurance provider and there\\'s nothing we can really do \\'\\' is an insult equivalent to rubbing salt in the wound. Way to be more of the problem than the solution. \\n\\n\\nIf you have XXXX with your Visa XXXX or other travel based credit card please stay away from using this insurer. I was super optimistic about this perk with my Chase Sapphire Reserve but  now have found it to be absolutely worthless. I\\'ve heard the insurance on XXXX XXXX is better but I\\'ll have to see for myself. This company is without a doubt useless and scammy and is in dire need a class action lawsuit against them.',\n",

But would not tell me what it was about. A couple days later a representative XXXX XXXX called me at work regarding this case. My son was an authorized user on the account. He was also paying the credit card statement in full each month. He contacted the credit bureau regarding these charges as he thought his credit card information had been stolen. They removed his name to solve the issue with the credit bureau. XXXX XXXX called me about a week later saying that I was responsible for the charges since other unrelated charges where posted to the account and monthly payments were still being made which of course payments were being made to the account, and it was the only credit card that my son had in his name. I am pretty sure that is why my son didn't really notice the charges as they started so small, and he paid his balance off in full each month. He was using the card at the same time and paying it in full each month. I wrote to Chase 's fraud department in writing asking them for a new card since the executive office wasn't a lot of help in XX/XX/XXXX. I never received one. I have used my card on and off but once they offered the lock for my card I just locked it as I am trying to pay off a bill that is not mine. On XX/XX/XXXX 2 charges were made against my account in XXXX Michigan for gas. I called Chase right away and they pretty much accused me of using my card there. I live in Minnesota, no where near Michigan. Since my card was locked those charges should have been declined. The reason they did show up was because I unlocked my account to grab a burger at XXXX XXXX and then went to lock it and saw the charges. They have issued me a new card. I did go to the XXXX XXXX XXXX to bring this up but again they stand behind there decision that I am liable for purchase of bitcoin that I never bought. They suggest that I I try to solve the matter outside the bank. I do have another credit card from Chase and have never had an issue. However I do believe my credit card information was hacked. However once the credit card was at it's limit they quit charging on the account.\",\n",

In order to place an exception hold on an item, the bank must have specific reason to doubt collectability. They did not contact my bank to verify funds. If they had, they would have been informed that the funds were available. I have no negative history with Chase ( returned deposits, NSF \\'s, etc. ) The check was made payable only to me and I endorsed the check properly. \\n\\nThere was no legitimate reason to doubt collectability on this item. The hold was placed on my deposit arbitrarily, which is a violation of Reg CC. \\n\\nI contacted Chase yesterday to request the hold be removed. The customer service representative that I spoke to told me the hold could not be removed until the item posted, so I would have to call back the next day. But she told me she would put a note on the account that the funds should be released based on \" my file \\'\\'. I called back the next day and got a different CSR. This individual acknowledged the note on the account stating the funds could be released, however she refused to do so. She said she needed to see if the funds had cleared first. She put me on hold, came back and said they had not cleared. She then said she would contact my bank to verify collectability ( proving that this had not been done prior to the hold being placed ). The bank verified the funds. Finally, she agreed to release the hold. \\n\\nThe funds are now available to me. However, the fact that this hold was placed on my deposit basically automatically with no due diligence on the financial institution \\'s part, I believe this is a systemic issue and that other customer \\'s are being taken advantage of without realizing the bank is violating regulation.

I was informed that I am unable to make this change in person and that I must fax in a form that can allegedly be found online. Additionally, I was told I should wait to change this information until after my next scheduled payment had been processed. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I called Chase customer service for assistance since attempts to access the online form resulted in errors. During this call, I was passed to 3 different representatives, each time being instructed to go to their website to download the same form that resulted in error messages. Finally, the last person I spoke with was able to explain that my loan was associated with something called XXXX. They informed me that as XX/XX/2019, Chase is no longer associated with XXXX and that due to this, I am unable to simply update the account that I would like to pay my auto loan through and would need to apply for a new loan with Chase in order to pay from a different account. I was finally told that I would be sent the form to change the account for the automatic payments and I should receive the form in about 7 business days. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019 I received a letter in the mail from Chase stating \" We have enclosed an Automatic Change Agreement for you to complete. \\'\\' Unfortunately, there was no form enclosed. I called their Customer Service again on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX CST to speak to someone about this issue. Once again, I was informed that there is nothing they can do to update my source of payment. After being on the phone for 20 minutes with this representative, I was transferred to a manager who told me they would actually send the form this time. \\n\\nPlease note, that nearly a month later as of XX/XX/2019 I have yet to be able to cancel my checking account with Chase. Furthermore, as of XX/XX/2019 I will be assessed a {$12.00} service fee for an account I have been trying to close for over a month. \\n\\nForcing me to apply for a new loan and negatively impact my credit just to be able to pay my current loan from a different non-Chase account feels extremely unfair and I feel as though Chase is intentionally delaying my ability to change the source of my payments in order to get more fees from me.',\n",

I tired explaining them that I already said the same things in the initial time of opening the account and that time your guys promised me that they will honor it and after 2.5 months you are declining it. She kept on apologizing as their banking officials but refused to honor this and told me to check with branch officials and closed my case. I completely felt cheated as I didn\\'t conceal anything and told everything before clearly.',\n",

I need to refinance my house, but on my credit is a joint credit card that has late payments on it and has been lowering my credit score since XXXX of this year. In XXXX, my fianc accepted a preapproved credit card from Chase Bank and added me as an authorized user without my permission. According to her credit card statement, nothing had been charged to the card since XXXX of XXXX and the balance should have been $ XXXX $ XXXX {$3300.00}. The balance is now {$5300.00}. She had automatic payments withdrawn for over a year, until they started adding an addition XXXX XXXX/month of interest in XXXX of XXXX. After that, my wife had a baby and was out of work for three months. She kept paying until XXXX, but then could no longer afford the extra $ 100/month interest. After that, they also added $ XXXX/month late fees. I met with my lawyer this week and he said for her to call them and have them remove me. Chase Bank told her she had to make a payment of {$1400.00} in order to remove me. Which she clearly doesn't have. She called again today, and after being transferred all over the place for nearly an hour, she eventually talked to someone who could help her. She offered to make a payment of {$200.00} if they would remove my name. They finally agreed that they would remove my name if she made a direct payment from her bank account of {$250.00}. However, as soon as she made the payment, they still refused to take my name off the card.\",\n",

Once in the air at altitude, I discovered that the seat did not fully recline as advertised, and functioned more as an economy seat. I mentioned it to the flight crew, the seat was not fixable. I had no recourse to fix this, was stuck in a broken seat beyond my control. Once landing, I reached out to XXXX to explain the issue. Their response was to credit me {$200.00}.

XXXX did not remedy the situation, so I filed a dispute with Chase. \\n\\nThe response from Chase was wholly inadequate and disingenuous. Chase responded that because I accepted services from XXXX, I was not entitled to any refund and my dispute was denied. \\n\\nI find this unacceptable and incorrect.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'This scam happened to me on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX. A XXXX year old named XXXX XXXX post pictures frequently on his XXXX  story If you wan na make money s/u ( slide up, which means to message him ). Or hed post XXXX Method with cash in the background. He posted the same question a couple of times but only this time I slid up. I asked him how. He responded with a list that he needed which was : Social Security, bank card number, back of the card number, and all of my other personal information. I wasnt going to give that up. A couple days more, I slid up on his story again and I asked about if there was another way to make money. He asked me if I had Chase Bank, I responded yes. He wanted to use XXXX-which Ive never used before till then- I asked whats the XXXX method. He said its a method that doubles the amount of money you send and we needed to transfer phone numbers. So we did. Then he claims that he has a special code that needs to go in the memo section. He sent the long code. Then he said to send him a dollar. We were on the phone a couple of times through the process. XXXX even asked me how much I had on my account but he was saying to do it and trust him because he has insurance. He asked where I lived and where I work. He made me believe he was trying to get to know me ( because Im a XXXX  ). After a few minutes, I sent him a dollar. A couple minutes later {$16.00} ( bait ) transferred in my account. That was the bargain. That made me believe it actually works. After that, he said to send {$310.00}. I did. He said to wait for about an hour. He said he got the money, but i told him on my end it didnt go through. He said to wait longer. Then he said its bc the codes werent working. So he sent a different code. Then XXXX said send another XXXX so it would work. I agreed. After that I was scared because I didnt know if itd actually work. A few hours later he wasnt responding. I texted him that I didnt see anything in my account still. He tried to convince me again to send ANOTHER {$310.00}. I refused bc it was too much. So i asked if itd work with {$10.00}. He said yes. And after that. He didnt respond. The next day came and Im still thinking about my money. I spammed him asking where is my money and to send it back. I called him too. Eventually he blocked my number, XXXX, and even XXXX  ( except for my side accounts. ) I lost {$630.00} in total. I texted him. Ill send the screen shots. Later on, his name was searched online and he was charged 2 times for theft and XXXX. The same day, I called the number from the back of my bank card. To some it up, there was nothing they could do. A couple days later I walked in Chase Bank and told them my situation. There was nothing they could do about it. Under so much stress about MY HARD earned money, I balled my eyes out. I was so close to finally purchasing my own car. He caused emotional distress and it was hard focusing in school. Please help me get my money back.',\n",

Its been more than a month and some days and all I get from them is a run around, they tell me I need to register the business in Florida but its already a registered business in Washington where the business is actually located and Florida is just my state of residence, yet they insist that I must register it in Florida which I dont find advisable since I do not operate my business in Florida, Secondly I have taken all prove of business to them already which should be sufficient enough but rather I am getting a run around each time I visit the bank or call to check on my account status. \\n\\nI have been given the run around over and over, I called the number I was given by the bank manager and after calling and being on hold for over hours they said they were going to hold on to the money in my account without giving any reason to it. \\n\\nPlease I would like you to assist in getting this issue resolved.',\n",

The item was initially refunded and all was well. XX/XX/2019, the credit card was charged again for this item and that is when everything went downhill with chase. Someone had opened a dispute with them and they stated we had to submit tracking information for the return of this item. When there was no response they closed it in favor of the seller. We had no idea that there was even a dispute. The letter received was online and because we did not know there was a dispute, because neither of us recall contacting chase, we did not look at the online letters. If that was the case, we would have promptly provided the documentation needed to be refunded. After talking with amazon and chase for over a month because somehow, a dispute was reopened. Tracking information was provided again and on XX/XX/XXXX, we received another letter from chase stating the charge was valid. After speaking with XXXX with chase disputes in XXXX XXXX Texas, he stated that the charge was valid and deemed valid because the tracking information was not provided in the initial time frame on the initial dispute. Basically, after reopening the the dispute, the tracking information provided on the second time disputed was not looked at and that the only way that we can dispute this again is to write a written letter disputing it and why we are disputing it. This is for over 1000 dollars and tracking information as well as documentation from amazon and the seller provides proof that the charge is not valid. We were not asked to provide any other information this time other than tracking so if the tracking was not going to be enough, I should have been told this one of the 23 times I called about this dispute. This is an illegal practice and there is no legal way that this charge is even valid. Their process for determining that this is a legal charge is not right and should be corrected along with all the time and money Ive spent disputing this charge. The seller stated that the item was returned and that they refunded a smaller portion due to signs of use and the item was working which is not fair either because the item did not work. Regardless I dont have the item!',\n",

Was told that the problem ( dating back to XX/XX/2019 ) was the result of an agent error they didnt enter the checking account number correctly - 9 digits instead of 10 - and therefore it was rejected. I reminded them that I had called AND submitted payment online several times AND had confirmed the account number with various people at Chase, in total at least 6 times over the course of the last two months. Provided account information for XX/XX/XXXX payment and was told it would post within 48 hours. Confirmation # XXXX. Asked what Chase planned to do to compensate me for my time. After being put on hold, was told that Chase would waive the late fees for XX/XX/2019. Informed them that this was insulting given the issue was caused by them.\\n\\nXX/XX/2019 Payment appears to have posted. Late fee assessed onXX/XX/2019 remains.',\n",

I said, NO, it was not fraudulent ( although I question that ), but the XXXX company auto charged it and I wanted it removed. Chase said that they would remove it. Meanwhile, I sent an email to XXXX XXXX member care to handle the issue, and she was sorry, but she couldn't, blah, blah, blah. Both companies have been making me the go between for their laziness and mistakes. My husband works midnights. He gives me full permission to handle all the conflict these two companies have called with repeat phone calls to me, but they insist on me waking him up, asking him a million questions, and then letting him give the phone back to me.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I have tried calling the fraud investigator at XXXX extension XXXX on XX/XX/2019. I called also every day since then and this employees mailbox is full. I can not leave a message and I am prompted to call customer service. \\nWhen I called customer service I was on hold for 30 minutes to be transferred to the fraud department. The employee in the fraud department informed me that chase would not do anything to help me get my money back. He informed me to contact customer service for XXXX  XXXX to get my money back. He is so misinformed that when I have tried contact XXXX  XXXX and they do not respond. For instance, when I email the financial department I do not get a response. They also have a D-rating with the XXXX XXXX XXXX   and are not responding to complaints. XXXX : XXXX What bothers me is the arrogance that this employee in the fraud department was talking. He was not listening to me and at the end of our conversation instead of continuing to listen to me he transferred me to another department while I was still talking to him. This is so unprofessional. \\nHe also made more mistakes the merchandise was returned to XXXX   XXXX. The merchandise was returned to XXXX XXXX and the tracking number is XXXX. XXXX XXXX   informed me that I was going to be refunded on XXXX for this charge and they have not done this. I was promised a refund and they then took it back Since chase is a large bank I would hope that they would be able to hire people that are competent and can do their job. This clearly has not been the case. \\nI am not okay with this because I have returned the merchandise to XXXX  XXXX  and they are charging me, Chase has done nothing to help me with this problem. Instead they have been more receptive to XXXX  XXXX. To date I still have not heard back from chase regarding this matter. I have been only informed to call the fraud department. \\nI just want to say that I am your customer XXXX XXXX is not. I think my bank would have the decency to call me and I would be able to reach the fraud investigator conducting the investigation. I will not be renewing this card and paying the annual fee. I am paying my annual fees and I am using your card with merchants which are also earning you money. Chase should be working for me to get my money bank not only responding to XXXX XXXX. This investigation and professionalism by Chase has been so egregious. To have such arrogant and incompetent employees has been frustrating and confusing. I think its important for a customer to have access to the person conducting the investigation. I would hope they do not put others customer through this and are more professional. \\n\\nWhat also has rubbed me the wrong was is why chase is not asking me to fill out an affidavit or provide them with a police report. If they are not sure if the charge is not valid they should have asked for this information. Lying on a police report is a class A misdemeanor. You should have asked for a police report before making a decision. The importance of doing that is discussed here https : XXXX What also worries me is I did not physically make that purchase and it was just charged to my credit card. I don't know how my bank can be okay with a charge being applied to my credit card when I did not make a purchase for that charge. So Chase is expecting me to pay {$120.00} dollars for no merchandise which is unacceptable. This is why I am mad they are forcing me to pay for an item that I never bought and there is an unauthorized charge. \\nThe last thing is I do not live at XXXX XXXX XXXX anymore. I have called you guys to inform you of this and updated my credit card address. This order was recharged to an address of XXXX XXXX XXXX not XXXX XXXX XXXX. I live on XXXX XXXX XXXX and the person in the fraud department was saying that this was the address that was charged to XXXX XXXX XXXX which is a previous address. When I opened the account the XXXX XXXX XXXX  address is there because that is what the business address is registered to. \\nIf this is also believed not to be a fraud case then chase should be making an effort to dispute this charge. Please refund me my money\",\n",

They came back with conclusion that this was 2 separate orders and the charges were valid. In the meantime, I received an email from XXXX stating that they determined the first order was never picked up and they had processed a refund in the amount of XXXX to my chase visa debit card. I never received this credit. I contacted chase again and they opened another case. I provided the transaction ID from XXXX for the refund and Chase still came to the conclusion that the charge was valid. I called XXXX again and they again provided me with an email receipt showing the date and amount the refund was processed ( {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ) and again provided the transaction ID. I faxed this yet again to chase and they are still stating they will have to review the case and contact me. It has now been 2 business days and they stated they would get back to me in one business day. Its also worth noting that on XX/XX/XXXX I went into a Chase branch and tried to get a resolution and the banker took my information and assured me someone from the escalated claims department would contact me in 3-5 business days. No one ever contacted me. Its absurd to me that a bank can keep my money which was refunded to me by the merchant. Also, Chase came to the conclusion that the charge was valid when I provided them with proof from the Merchant that the merchant was admitting the charge was not valid. Im frustrated and want my money back.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Hello- \\nAround XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I tried to book a package deal vacation on XXXX.  The package was to include rountrip airfare and hotel stay for roughly a week for 2 people in XXXX XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX.  I tried to book the package and put in my credit card information but when I pressed the confirm button I was given a message that said something along the lines of - we cannot fulfill this reservation, use another payment method and the currrent deal is no longer available (I got both- tried more than once).  After being really frustrrated, I just decided that if XXXX  wasn't going to allow me to book the deal, I wasn't going to go.  I thought nothing of it and moved on.  On my XXXX  credit card statement I had a charge for $XXXX from a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.  I didn't recognize it so I reported it to my Chase card as fraud.  I was issued a new card, they removed the charge as fraudulent and I moved on.  Until it reappeared on my account.  When I called Chase they provided a bit more information- they told me that it was a hotel that had my email, phone number and credit card information and a booking number from XXXX (which I then learned was related to XXXX).  I thought that maybe this was something related to my attempt to book a XXXX  vacation back in XXXX, and Chase said that it appeared to be.  They wouldn't give me the confirmation number or anything else, but told me that given this it wasn't fraud, I'd need to deal directly with XXXX.  Well, that is nearly impossible.  XXXX  won't answer the phone or discuss anything with you unless you have a confirmation number, which I did not have because I never made a reservation!  After spending hours on the phone with XXXX  and logging into my XXXX account (which I only have because I booked another trip around the same time for XXXX  that went through fine through XXXX  and when I found out the two were related saw that I had an account with XXXX because of it.) XXXX made it clear that neither it or XXXX   could help me because they did not have any confirmation of any reservation being made.  I called my credit card company, Chase and again spent hours on the phone explaining the circumstances and finally someone at Chase tried to call XXXX.  It sounded like XXXX, from Chase finally talked to someone at XXXX by using the info the hotel had provided to it, and to someone at XXXX   and both confirmed to XXXX at Chase that NO RESERVATION WAS EVER MADE.  XXXX indicated that she would work on it and the charge would be removed.  This was in XXXX.  Well, I just got my bill and it has reappeared- the same charge.  I'm at a loss for what to do about this.  I never authorized a charge.  XXXX  clearly impermissibly took my credit card and personal information and transmitted it to XXXX, which must have been the point of transmission to the hotel, and yet that was never authorized, and they indicated that the deal was not available.  I've gone in circles and trying to resolve this, but now Chase is saying this isn't fraud because I provided XXXX with my information.  However, XXXX clearly indicated that no reservation was made.  I have no confirmation information, and no information for the alleged reservation is in XXXX system.  However the hotel keeps reinstating the charge and challenging this, and Chase keeps putting it back on my bill.  This is atrocious!  I in no way authorized this charge and not a single company involved will take any ownership and fix this.   \\n\\nI am beyond frustrated.  XXXX  is misusing customer information and I can't get any resolution, despite spending hours of my time trying to resolve this.  \\n\\nI wish I had something to attach, but because I NEVER made a reservation, and never recieved anything from XXXX  or XXXX (except a pop up window from XXXX  declaring that a reservation couldn't be made or that the deal was no longer availale, which I clearly didn't screenshot to keep).I have nothing that I can attach.  I could log into my XXXX account and show that there is no reservation for this hotel, but that's about it, and I won't attach that here.\",\n",

The ad says open a Sapphire Checking account and enjoy XXXX Chase ultimate rewards bonus points and since i travelled a lot it is very enticing to me. I went ahead and open the Sapphire Checking account online ( direct link from the e-mail around XX/XX/XXXX and by XX/XX/2019 I was able to complete their requirement of {$75000.00} total deposit in the account. Per the flyer they will credit me the XXXX points after 45 days of completing the deposit requirement. I called the bank after 45 days cause i don\\'t see it being credited to my account and they said that I mis-read it and it should be after 90 days. I went ahead and just honor what they said and waited another 45 days to get the points. I have been checking my online account and nothing is happening and its been more than 90 days. I went ahead and call the customer service again sometime around beginning of XX/XX/XXXX and I was passed on to different people until I was referred to the Sapphire Checking specialist. He said that there was no code loaded in the account when it was opened therefore they can not do anything. Please note that i opened the account from the link they provided in the e-mail and it specifically stated that \" your coupon will be applied automatically \\'\\'. I asked to be referred to the manager but he won\\'t transfer me but he said he will put a note on the system to call me. He also suggested to go to the local branch and they maybe able to help me out. I never got a call nor an e-mail from the manager so I went ahead and went to the branch at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with a representative and I also showed him a copy of the e-mail I received and he called some people and was not able to help me either so I asked for the manager. At first he was hesitant to refer me to the manager bragging that he knows everything and that the manager will say the same thing anyways. Finally after telling him that I will close my account he went ahead and call the Acting Manager that day. She was very sympathetic and understand my situation but can not take any action because she has to escalate it to the proper branch. She promised to call me back by Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. She called me and left a message that Monday or Tuesday to tell me that she needs more time. I left her a voicemail to update me by e-mail because I will be out for 3 week going outside the country. I got an e-mail from a manager but not sure if the same branch but did not give me any resolution to the issue. When I got back I went ahead and went to the branch ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and of course there is no manager to talk to. The person I spoke with said the same thing again that the account was not coded. I\\'m not really sure if they work on it or not but I\\'m really mad and fed up and i just closed the account. At this point I don\\'t want to waste the interest I could have earned from that money to the bank.',\n",

By XX/XX/2019, both accounts had been closed due to the additional inquiry I obtained when applying for their card. And also what they described as my being risky due to searching for more credit. Now I have two closed accounts and two inquiries that are negatively impacting me. They gave me the credit then took it away because I applied for a card that they pushed for me to apply for. And then when I asked for a refund of annual fee I was told I would not receive the refund. Chase does not care about their customers.

All of my money was going to heat and electric and food. I even wiped my retirement account just to keep the house afloat. I contacted chase again and asked them to just hold on for two months until I was back at work. They said okay that's fine to take care of your health. Then the next month they closed my accounts. I'm drowning in it. I can't believe after years of an excellent business relationship this multi-million dollar company couldn't give me a three-month stay. I'm back to work now, one month behind on my mortgage and hundreds of dollars in fees later from chase.

I suggest everyone file complaints with the Feds everytime this happens. As usual, when I have plenty of funds that there is no way to manipulate fees, my deposits from my online shop or my retirement will ALWAYS POST PRIOR TO WITHDRAWS. But when there is a way to manipulate the two, usually end of month when I am very tight and when I am awaiting a deposit to hit to cover withdraws or checks for that day or week, they will pend the deposit, which they never do if I have plenty of funds. They also will once again \" stack \\'\\' checks. This month they took a {$300.00} one that was written at XXXX XXXX that day over a {$120.00} that would have cleared no problem if withdrawn first that was deposited at XXXX XXXX  from my city of 300 residents. So instead of not pending my SSI they pend it so it won\\'t clear until the next day, than they take a {$300.00} check that over drafts me by a like {$20.00} before the {$120.00} that would have cleared no problem if presented first and charged me two fees. \\nThis is EXACTLY WHAT THEY WHERE SUED FOR IN 2012 I have filed a complaint with Feds every time. I print screen through out night to prove that at XXXX XXXX there was no checks presented and my SSI was pending but my available balance was over {$1600.00} due to that pending SSI guaranteed payment but somehow at XXXX XXXX my balance was in the negative, my SSI no longer available balance and I get charged for funds they had sitting at XXXX XXXX. \\nI already paid these scumbags with a bailout paid by my sweat.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I purchased my home through Chase mortgage in XX/XX/2017 as a first time homebuyer. On XX/XX/17, an escrow payment of {$320.00} was applied directly to the escrow account. Going forward, the original agreement, signed in good faith, indicated of the {$1000.00} monthly payment, {$140.00} would go towards the escrow account to cover insurance and property taxes. I set up an auto pay for {$1100.00} so {$88.00} additional principal would also be applied. These amounts were paid and applied appropriately until the payment on XX/XX/2017 where the escrow payment applied was dropped to {$64.00} ( down from the {$140.00} ) to continue paying the insurance but not the property taxes without my knowledge or consent. I was confused and unsure as to why this happened but, being a first-time homebuyer, assumed that because the previous home owner had a homestead exemption that granted him complete exemption from property taxes, the taxes may have been re-assessed and with already almost {$1000.00} in the escrow account the monthly amount withdrawn could now be reduced. Believing the bank would apply funds as necessary, I did not change my automatic payment - I continued the autopay that was set up to pay the monthly mortgage amount dictated by the bank plus the {$88.00} additional principal. \\n\\nRecently, I noticed a message on my online Chase mortgage account that indicating my monthly payment would be changed once again but this time from {$970.00} to {$1800.00}! It appears that because the bank failed to continue applying escrow towards the property taxes, they are now unfairly demanding that I double up on tax payments this year to clear last year \\'s property taxes and put money into escrow for this year \\'s property taxes. Of the {$1800.00} payment, it appears they are applying {$510.00} towards \" escrow shortage \\'\\' ( short due to the bank \\'s error )  and {$390.00} towards property taxes. As you can imagine, nearly doubling the monthly payment on a mortgage would no doubt create a severe financial hardship on a single mother. I feel the bank was misleading and deceptive in their erroneous practice of changing the monthly payment without my consent and then expecting me to pay twice the amount in property to make up for their mistake.',\n",

I went online and noticed that when I had been paying with my debit card the purchases were being taken out of my checking, savings and it on a card that wasn't mine. I went to the branch and the VP, cancelled the new cards, closed my checking accounts and gave me a number to call to file the credit card fraud since it was a different Dept. We opened up new accounts and wi agreed to freeze the fraud one so I wouldn't have access and in the meantime they would mice my wires into new account. I called the credit card division, claim numbers and they couldn't find my XXXX XXXX payment nor the XXXX payment which the card had XXXX balance. The fraud card had XXXX XXXX on it. I received letters on the status followed up but when I asked if they were issuing me a new card they said no to apply on line and I was a victim of identity theft. They then told me I was responsible for the other card which that card was in my possession for three days since someone make a XXXX payment, I said it was not me since I knew it was cancelled. Then the credit card calls me to collect on the fraud card and I told her what happened she said there is no record of me calling to file the complaint. I said I received letters in the mail and whom have been giving my personal information to?

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/2019, my Social Security XXXX deposit was withheld by JPMorgan Chase. Upon calling the branch to determine why, I was told that Chase had decided, on XX/XX/2019 to \" end the relationship \\'\\' with me. I was told, at that time, that Chase did \" not have to provide a reason \\'\\' and that there \" was nothing ( I ) could do ... \\'\\' I had no \" right to appeal ... It was a final decision. \\'\\' After numerous conversations, I was told by Chase, I had to wait an additional two days before receiving my deposit and even then, it was up to the bank whether or not I would receive cash, or if the bank would send a cashier \\'s checks to my home or if the bank would return my payment to Social Security. This, of course, would mean I would then have to wait an additional 15 or so days without any money. I stated that this unreasonable decision put me in an untenable situation, as my bills were due, my house payment was due, I had no other income besides Social Security. The representative from the Loss Prevention Department I spoke with at approximately XXXX said, \" You don\\'t have to like the decision but that is the decision, \\'\\' completely and thoroughly disregarding the havoc and potential loss of residence and numerous late fees this represented to me. \\n\\nToday, XX/XX/2019, at approximately XXXX XXXX., I contacted Chase again to find out if there was any decision made about how I was to receive my money, I was again transferred to the Loss Prevention Department. The magnitude of that finally pierced through. I asked the representative if the fact that my account was with the Loss Prevention Department was a indictment of me and/or an implication of a potential fraudulent transaction. I was, once again told, the bank didn\\'t have to provide me with \" any answers, \\'\\' in quite a rude and snarky manner. \\n\\nI can\\'t imagine what would have been considered a fraudulent transaction. The last interaction I had with Chase, prior to this, was to dispute a transaction for a purchase made through XXXX in which XXXX, overrode my preferred credit card and changed to a credit card associated with the Chase account. This decision then caused my Chase account to be overdrawn. After disputing the transaction with XXXX, I was told XXXX \\'s \" security protocol \\'\\' had chosen to change the cards. I then disputed the transaction with Chase, explained the entirety of the situation including XXXX \\'s explanation of \" security protocol, \\'\\' and offered to submit documentation of this to Chase, in writing, from XXXX. Chase informed me that I would need to close the credit card used in the disputed transaction ; that I would be given a temporary credit of the disputed amount ; and that Chase would investigate. The next interaction was my calling to determine what happened to my Social Security deposit. I don\\'t understand how a bank can simply close a banking account, accept and then withhold government authorized XXXX funds, with absolutely no oversight. \\n\\nAs a XXXX customer, whose only source of income is Social Security XXXX, a fact the bank was very well aware of when they chose to accept my deposit, per the Social Security administration on XX/XX/XXXX, I should have at the very least been given a warning, an opportunity to explain and submit documentation in response to any additional concerns the bank may have had regarding the disputed transaction. And, certainly, as the bank has already confirmed, my funds are simply on hold. I should not have to wait any additional days in limbo. I definitely should not have to pay all the associated late fees from the withholding of my money. Chase certainly should not be allowed to profit from accepting a deposit into an account that they had already chosen to close, one full day prior to the deposit being submitted.',\n",

She also advised it would take at least 30 days to get a response from XXXX. I followed her direction. \\nI waited and after two months called to follow up as I had received nothing in writing. I finally received a confirmation letter in XXXX, Meanwhile Chase billed me several late fees and an Annual Renewal fee in XXXX. There collections dept. began calling saying I was incurring late fees and I needed to pay them. They also stated they had nothing in their system that a dispute was active. At that time I also had no correspondence that my complaint was in dispute status, I did not pay them this fee. I did not trust they would not turn around and put it toward the charges I was disputing and determine the rest had to be paid. I had advised them of this during their and my phone calls. I called the Chase directly and spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX after one of the above calls was received by me. He assured me he would handle it and gave me a case number XXXX I never received a final determination in writing from them and called them about the late fees that were charged to my account. They reversed the during that call on XX/XX/XXXX. They told me I had a XXXX balance for annual fees for XXXX. I paid that via phone and then the Rep told me the card was closed. This month XX/XX/XXXX I received a bill for XXXX. I called them and they said they reversed fees twice in error and this was the balance due. This has been a complete and total run around I have gotten from XXXX Chase Cardservices. I do not recommend them. One of my biggest concerns is that I have great credit and they put this on my credit report as a non payment issue vs disputed charges. In addition to charging a XXXX annual fee for a card they closed, none of this was put in writing as a final decision on their part.',\n",

I was grossly overcharged for my stay at the XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. I had paid cash and the perceived balance by card but was not properly credited for my stay. I had an earlier dispute on this transaction denied by Chase of {$480.00} which that amount is incorrect. For the record the amount in dispute is {$600.00} as shown on this letterhead. I faxed my inquiry to Chase but somehow they refuse to look into this matter. I am requesting that the error be corrected, that any finance and other charges related to the disputed amount be credited as well, and that I receive an accurate statement. \\n\\nEnclosed is a copy of the letterheads from the XXXX XXXX XXXX supporting my position.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'XX/XX/2019 I had let my son use my XXXX so he could use my Gas Credit Card that was attached to my XXXX XXXX! Well he accidentally used my Chase debit card in my XXXX XXXX  wallet. So needless to say all night he was filling up small engines with gas ( Generators, Gas Cans, Etc.. ) well in the morning he comes home and I than realized he used the wrong account not every time but enough to overdraft my account by a couple hundred dollars! I immediately called the bank to let them know and aware of what happened, they seemed to understand and I asked if they could help me with the NSF fees as my account was almost negative {$500.00} dollars and my XXXX check is only {$480.00} every 14 days so the guy said Yes we will waive any and all fees that appear on the account from these transactions. So, I was relieved for that up until my check goes in direct deposit and I still had those fees on my account so I called and talked on the phone for 1.3 hours and transferred minimum of ten times and was lied to at the end just to get me off the phone is what I got from it and still no fees taking off. I called again 35 minutes and got told cant do anything I reached maximum fee reversal allotted!?! What!?!? So than called later and than they told me I had to cancel my dispute I had from prior to all this just so the guy can move forward with assisting me and than was told I would get 2 reversed ( So obviously I didnt hit maximum, so theres one lie I caught them in ) and so I said fine whatever I wont eat for two weeks than. Well hang up and it has been 25 in a half hours and that credit of two fees still not applied and called and was told it takes 7 to 10 business days before it will reflect on my account!! Are you serious but before it was instant, Another Lie!! Needless to say Highway Robbery and Bad Business',\n",

We responded to the text messages by stating NO these charges were not authorized. The Chase Southwest Card was one of the cards that sent a text as well and they were CALLED immediately after they sent the notification and they were told the card was stolen and stated the charges were not authorized and to close the account. I had three cards in my wallet my ID, health insurance cards etc were taken. We contacted all three credit card companies that had been take. We closed al three credit card accounts as as our our bank and checking accounts. I filed a police report and had to get a new ID as well. The Unauthorized Charges were processed at XXXX XXXX stores in the XXXX area. Two of the three cards did send letters stating they did see these charges were not authorized and they credited our account. Chase Southwest is stating they will not credit our account and they find these charges valid after they reviewed our account. I have provided information several times to Chase Southwest card services on many occasions as they would not tell us what they needed up front. ( we provided all documentation requested to Chase Southwest to prove these were fraudulent charges ) Chase card service has a copy of our time cards, police report and our ID 's as well as other letters from the other credit card companies that stated they have found these charges as fraudulent and nothing has seemed to help them see these charges were not valid. We have contacted an attorney which wrote a letter on our behalf requesting they re consider the decision made as we have provided them with several documents to prove we did not authorize these charges and could had not possibly made these charges as we were at work. We are asking for help in this matter as we have been advised from our attorney file a formal complaint against Chase Southwest. Please find attached documents we have sent to Chase Southwest on many occasions, as documentation the charges are charges that we did NOT authorize. The only response we have received since the attorney sent the letter ( second time it was sent ) was a copy of our statement which had nothing to do with what the attorney had requested and no letter was attached.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a bluetooh headphone in XXXX XXXX 's in-flight store as I traveled on one of their planes. I received the item near the end of the flight as passengers were disembarking, which was not an issue as I was not planning on using it while on the flight anyways. \\n\\nUpon returning home and opening the item, I discovered that it was defective, such as headphones not connecting, sound only coming out of one or the other ear, sound having lots of static. These issues were consistent when using the headphone on multiple devices. \\n\\nI attempted to reach out to the merchant, but from my research my understanding is that the airline is based in XXXX and their main call center is in XXXX. I endured long wait times ( 40 minutes - 1 hour+ ), and got XXXX speaking representatives. I would have to hang up and call again to try and reach an English speaking representative. When I finally got in touch with one I was simply told that their policy does not allow returns. \\n\\nThis is in contrast to US consumer protection laws and Visa 's card processing guidelines. Clearly in XXXX a costumer should be able to receive a refund for a purchased item that is defective. \\n\\nIt is under these circumstances that I reached out to Chase and initiated a dispute. I gave them the same explanation and context that I had made multiple attempts to work with the merchant and was not given a resolution. \\n\\nA summary of the next events : XX/XX/XXXX : Chase digitally sends a letter from the merchant with an email address and XXXX phone number for me to contact them for resolution. I was told this letter would be under my statements but did not find it there. \\n\\nAround XXXX : XXXX, a Chase representative, gets back in touch with me and ask me to try looking for the letter in different areas of their website. After trying several different areas of the website I found the letter. I explained my concern that I had already tried calling the merchant and did not get a resolution. I asked if the merchant does not respond, does that give me grounds to continue with the dispute, and if so what is the last date to continue the dispute? XXXX answered affirmatively that certainly if the merchant is non-responsive then we can continue with the dispute, with the deadline being XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : I email the merchant at the email address provided to me and explain I am looking for a resolution. The merchant does not reply. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : XXXX calls me again and I explain that the merchant has not replied to my email. XXXX provides me with a Chase email address to forward my email to her as evidence. I comply with her request exactly as she states. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : Today, XXXX called me and informed me that she received the email I sent her that she requested. However, because I made this purchase in-person, I had the opportunity to inspect the item and thus I did not have the right to dispute the charge. \\n\\nThat reasoning does not sound valid to me. There are millions of in-person purchases each day. Especially with electronics, even if you purchase it in person you may not be able to confirm that it is working. If I purchase an video game console, would I demand that the merchant allow me to connect it to their TV and electric outlet in order to test that it is in good working order? In my case, I made this purchase in-flight near the end of the flight. Many times while in the air we are instructed to put our phones away, and I had no intention of using this new item while on the flight. I have never been instructed to verify the condition of an in-purchase item, otherwise I would lose my right to a refund. \\n\\nWhen I asked XXXX which specific Chase policy/guideline stated that I had to inspect an in-person purchase otherwise I would lose my right to a dispute, she said it was not a Chase policy/guideline. \\n\\nI then asked XXXX since it is not a Chase policy/guideline, it must be a Visa policy and asked her to identify which specific policy it is. XXXX said she can not tell me which policy it is but that I am free to look it up myself. \\n\\nThis is contrary to every experience I have had with disputes. Banks are not prevented from telling their cardholders Visa 's policies as those are the policies that they must follow. In fact the opposite is quite true. Banks must be transparent about the Visa policies that they are beholden to and must follow. \\n\\nIt appears that perhaps a mistake was made by XXXX, and after I provided her with the email she did not continue with the dispute as she should have. Now that the deadline is passed she is unable to continue the dispute and has to find a reason to reject my dispute. \\n\\nUnder Visa guidelines there are time limits to when a costumer can seek a dispute for a resolution. I have worked with XXXX in good faith to resolve this and provided all the information she requested in the time frames she has requested them. I have upheld my responsibilities as the cardholder and customer, and XXXX while acting as Chase 's representative did not.\",\n",

A few days later, I found both my checking account and saving account were frozen. I called Chase custom service and they said they can't find my wife 's ID! \\n\\nThen, we went to the branch the third time and re-scanned all our documents, and finally had our accounts activated again. \\n\\nDue to the period of the account frozen, we had been charged at least {$58.00} for returned payment. The banker promised to handle it but never reply my inquiry email after I send him the documents about these charged bank fees. \\n\\nIn addition, we are very concerned about the way they handle our privacy and personal documents. We think this branch doesn't properly train their employees and they have no idea how to correctly handle custom 's personal documents. They lost my wife 's ID. \\n\\nIn summary. We want the branch to reimburse the loss caused by their mistake and have a full investigation on their way of handling customs ' personal documents.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I went through my statements and went through the process of reconciling my statements with the receipts I had and I noticed there were charges that I did not authorize. After identifying all of the purchases I did make and filtering out the ones I didn't make I called my credit card company on XX/XX/2019. The process of reporting was straightforward, however I did get some push-back as to not to call transactions fraud but to dispute them. I told the woman on the phone that: no, these are not disputes and they are fraud since I did not authorize them. When everything was finished the representative finished the process and I saw the credits on my next bill, I had to call back to report some she did not include or did not show until the next statement. On XX/XX/2019 a letter was generated and sent to me saying that all the charges I reported I benefited from. I thought that this was ridiculous and I called right away to have the case researched thoroughly and for a second time and I asked them to contact me with any questions and or to please provide me with any documentation they could bring up so that I may dispute if necessary. I received nothing and I thought all went in my favor. Then on XX/XX/2019 a new letter was generated and said that I still benefited from the fraud. I called again to get answers and all I received was: that a representative researched the claim and that they will not move forward with another evaluation unless I can provide documentation such as a police report, which is impossible as I did not live in the country in where most of the fraud occurred.\",\n",

One of the forms asked if we had cancelled the tickets. We said yes, since on XX/XX/XXXX we had replied to the travel website that we will not be using their tickets. We have never submitted the required paperwork for cancellation. We have also provided the email with the travel website admitting we were given 3 tickets + infant instead of 4. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX XXXX, Chase customer service representative told us we can't dispute the charge since the travel website was willing to work with us a few days prior to your departure date. He also said that 3/ 4 tickets were correct therefore the purchase was correct. How long should we have waited for the travel agency to fix this? They only acknowledged their error 6 days prior to our trip and even then we had no guarantees. XXXX said we had only contacted the travel website once even though we had provided 4 emails already to Chse. After the phone conversation we sent the credit company multiple other emails showing our prior attempts at reconciling this. \\nXX/XX/XXXX the charge was reinstated with the explanation that we had cancelled the tickets even though the tickets were non-refundable. We have replied that we disputed the charge because we had paid for 4 tickets but had only gotten 3 and XXXX lap infant ticket. We had never filled out the cancellation paperwork and asked the credit company to provide a valid explanation as to why the charge was reinstated.\",\n",

There is only one Chase Bank branch in the state of Minnesota, therefore I wanted to close this account without making the drive to the only location. There had been no activity on this account for two months as this account was not my primary checking account. \\n\\nContacted Chase Bank via telephone on XX/XX/19 to close both a Checking and Savings account with them. Savings account was closed immediately by the representative with the balance transferred to the still open checking account. I was transferred to another employee to assist with closing the checking account. Customer service representative said the account would be closed immediately with the checking account balance of {$1800.00} was to be paid via check sent to my home within 5 business days. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/19 ( 7 business days later ) the check had not arrived so I contacted Chase again via telephone. The account representative said the account had not been closed and check was not issued. This representative went through the same steps to close the account and promised me the account was closed and check would be in the mail the next business day. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/19, I noticed via online banking there was a negative balance of ( {$29.00} ) on my checking account. A check had been issued from Chase bank in the amount of {$1800.00} ( greater than my current balance ) which caused my account to overdraft and go negative. I contacted Chase again on XX/XX/19 to question how this had happened. The representative was unable to explain how this error occurred and was unable to quickly resolve the issue. The account was still not closed and was unable to be closed because the account balance was negative. After 45 minutes on the phone speaking to multiple people, I was finally able to get a stop order was placed on the issued check with a new one for the correct remaining balance issued the next day. I was told it would be another 7-10 business days before the check would arrive. \\n\\n21+ business days to close a checking account is unacceptable. This is NOT a reasonable time period for the bank to hold on to my money. I am not confident that this will even be resolved without another phone call.',\n",

The forged checks were deposited and attempted to be withdrawn, but Chase stopped the transaction. XX/XX/XXXX - Chase has identified unauthorized checks and asks me to contact them. XX/XX/XXXX - I contacted Chase and they could not verify my identity because I am located internationally at the moment. I contacted them several times and eventually shared all the information they required to confirm the false account is not mine. XX/XX/XXXX - My EXISTING online account is not working. When I contacted them, they said they have ended their relationship with me after people deposited and withdrew money in an newly opened account under my name. My existing account had XXXX and they deducted XXXX for issuing a check and have sent the remaining XXXX to me. As you can see, a NEW Chase account was opened under my name, but they closed by EXISTING account. First off, why did Chase allow a new account to be opened in my name? Second, when I inquired further, they closed my EXISTING account. My EXISTING account had nothing to do with this fraudulent activity. Why did Chase end their relationship with me so abruptly? Since the EXISTING account closed, which was my active bill paying account that I share with my wife and brother-in-law, we've had problems with bill payments ( many of them late ), deposits, etc. I could not access my history online and couldn't remember addresses to send bills. Chase has shut the door on me without any explanation and I want answers. Monetarily I can only ask for the {$24.00} fee that they deducted and the XXXX check that I never received. In addition, I want to understand why they decided to treat such a loyal customer like trash, and I wish I can paid for that as well.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'JP Morgan Chase defrauds credit card customers with hidden interest rate charges related to zero interest loans. \\n\\nSituation : Earlier this year I borrowed a zero percent credit card loan from my JP Morgan Chase Credit Card. Later I found I was being charged interest of 17.49 % p.a. on purchases, but on what amount of purchases? It was not disclosed on the credit card statement. After telephone calls with Chase, I found that the only way to determine the purchase amount was to subtract the zero interest loan balance from the credit card balance as shown on the statement, but the zero interest loan balance was also not shown on the credit card statement. In June I had to speak with a Chase credit card representative to find out the zero interest loan balance.\\n\\nI spoke with representatives twice. The first explanation of the interest charges was vague, confusing and incorrect. The second was correct. I was told the amount of the loan balance and the method to eliminate the interest charges : sequentially first pay off the minimum amount due ( {$140.00} in my case ), then separately pay off the purchases ( {$220.00} in my case ), calculated as follows : Amount Source Credit Card Balance {$14000.00} Credit Card Statement ( Exhibit 1 ) Less Zero Interest Loan {$14000.00} Chase Representative ( by Phone ) Purchases {$220.00} My Calculation on which 17.49 % Interest is to be Charged Interest Charges {$2.00} Credit Card Statement ( Exhibit 1 ) JP Morgan Chases practices are deceptive and fraudulent, resulting in consumers unknowingly paying punitively high interest charges without knowing how to avoid them. This practice represents another worse in consumer credit card banking, lacking full disclosure and proper transparency.',\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX I realized that I still had not received ANY paper work including an invoice from Chase Amazon card services. I contacted them on XXXX. I spoke with a representative who apologized and deducted the {$25.00} late fee that was applied to my account. She informed me that my account was in good standing and that I should see my XXXX Statement soon with the payment being due on the XXXX of every month. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019 I tried to make a purchase at a car service business and my card was declined. I called Chase Amazon Card Customer Service and spoke with the manager- XXXX XXXX She told me my card was declined due to non-payment. I explained to her that I had never received a statement or anything from them and could not make the payment until I did because it was a new account and I had never made a payment with them before. She basically told me Chase couldn't do anything about my Non-payment status and until the payment was received it would be declined. \\n\\nThis is absurd, considering it is of no fault of my own that the payment was not received. I explained to her that if they had my correct address which they are confident they do, then I would have received my invoice just like I received my card initially. I don't feel like the non-payment status is my fault and I feel like I am being punished for their mistake. I am seriously considering closing this account and opening a new account with a better company. I am not happy.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/XXXX, I was approved for a merchant account with JPMorgan Chase and its merchant division XXXX XXXX ( Merchant ID Number : XXXX ) after filing an application ( Application ID Number XXXX ) and speaking with XXXX XXXX, EVP Head of Sales of XXXX   XXXX. My reason for obtaining a merchant account was to start an online business and operate it as a sole proprietorship. Despite purchasing a website domain, I was never able to fully fulfill my goal due to the unethical and fraudulent business practices of JPMorgan Chase and XXXX   XXXX. As of the date of this complaint I do not own and or operate any sole proprietorship. \\nFrom XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, I was a customer of JPMorgan Chase and XXXX  XXXX. During that time, I fully complied with all terms, covenants, and conditions as outlined in the agreement. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX Risk Department informing me that my merchant account had been terminated due to a violation of section 10.3 of the merchant agreement. After spending the next week making repeated phone calls and sending emails to XXXX  XXXX customer service department, I still had no explanation as to exactly why my account had been terminated. At this point, I decided to apply with several other banks for a new merchant account. Each time, I was denied credit and was told that my name, address, birthday, social security number, and other personal information had been placed on XXXX  MATCH List, also known as the Terminated Merchant File ( TMF ). Through these credit denials, I learned that JPMorgan Chase had placed me on the MATCH List. As of the date of this complaint, no bank has approved me for a merchant account. \\nSince XX/XX/XXXX, I have contacted dozens of nameless customer service representatives from XXXX XXXX and JPMorgan Chase, which owns XXXX XXXX. No one could give me a reason why my account was terminated, nor were they able to confirm that JPMorgan Chase had placed me on the MATCH List. On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint against XXXX  XXXX with the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ). On XX/XX/XXXX, the complaint was closed because XXXX  XXXX never had the courtesy to respond to my complaint. During this time, I sent certified letters through the USPS to multiple XXXX  XXXX employees, specifically XXXX XXXX, President, XXXX XXXX, EVP of Sales, XXXX XXXX, Director, and XXXX XXXX, Director of Client Relations. In addition, I sent certified letters to XXXX XXXX, President of JPMorgan Chase Merchant Services and XXXX XXXX, CEO of Chase Commerce Services. As of the date of this letter, none of these individuals, with the exception of a representative for XXXX XXXX, have had the courtesy to respond to this vital matter. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the XXXX against JPMorgan Chase. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from JPMorgan Chases Executive Office from XXXX Ohio in response to my complaint. The letter included the terms of section 10.3, as cut and paste from the merchant agreement, along with a short statement that the reporting was accurate, and they were unable to remove me from the MATCH List. In response, I sent a letter demanding that they provide me with evidence that I had violated the terms, covenants, and conditions stated in section 10.3 of the merchant agreement. \\nI received a response from JPMorgan Chase, dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating they were sorry I was dissatisfied with how they had researched my concerns, but that their decision was final. Furthermore, they would no longer be able to respond to any of my concerns. After six months of contacting JPMorgan Chase by phone, email, and written letters, they still did not provide me with an explanation as to how I violated section 10.3. As a result, they have no legal justification for placing my name on the MATCH List. As of the date of this complaint, JPMorgan Chase still refuses to respond to my inquiries. Their lack of ethics in handling this matter is just one of the many reasons they have established such a sordid reputation in the banking industry. \\nRegarding XXXX  XXXX, the only person who responded to my complaints was a representative of XXXX XXXX named as XXXX XXXX, a paralegal for XXXX   XXXX. In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX stated XXXX  XXXX had been alerted of a violation involving my merchant account. She reported that my merchant account had been used to process a single transaction in the amount of {$79.00} on a website other than my own. The transaction was dated XX/XX/XXXX and involved the sale of XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) from the violating URL. This was a breach of the merchant agreement, resulting in JPMorgan Chase /XXXX  XXXX terminating my merchant agreement on XX/XX/XXXX and adding me to the XXXX MATCH List. \\nI responded to XXXX XXXX in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that my merchant account did not process any transactions in the amount of {$79.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I further explained that I had never sold XXXX  products. Furthermore, I am in no way associated with the violating URL. I followed up with another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX providing evidence to XXXX  XXXX showing that my merchant account had not processed a transaction in the amount of {$79.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, as they were falsely claiming. In my response, I offered to provide a sworn affidavit stating that my merchant account was never used to process any transactions on the violating URL. Additionally, I requested that XXXX  XXXX provide me with evidence to support their false claims that I had breached the merchant agreement. As of the date of this complaint, XXXX  XXXX has refused to respond to my inquiries. \\nUnder section 10.3 of the merchant agreement JPMorgan Chase can terminate our agreement by giving me thirty ( 30 ) days prior notice. The agreement further states that JPMorgan Chase can terminate the agreement if I failed to comply with any terms, covenants, and conditions. As I stated above, I always complied with the terms, covenants, and conditions outlined in the agreement and for JPMorgan Chase to claim otherwise is simply false. The information I provided with my merchant application was 100 % true, complete, and accurate. JPMorgan Chase was fully aware of the types of merchandise I sold and had approved by website and inventory after the agreement was signed. All transactions were processed in accordance with the merchant agreement and were valid and legal transactions between myself and the respected cardholder. At no time was my merchant account used for anything other than what it was intended, as stated in our agreement. \\nIn regard to putting my name on MATCH List, JPMorgan Chase had no legal authority to do so. ( This would be the case, even if I had violated the agreement, which I didnt. ) In recent years, XXXX has set strict guidelines on how banks can add individuals to the MATCH List. Specifically, for a person to be put on the list, he or she must be found to be involved in : fraud, money laundering, bankruptcy, theft, identity theft, merchant collusion, illegal transactions, fraud conviction, etc. I have advised JPMorgan Chase and XXXX XXXX that none of these conditions apply to me and anyone who claims otherwise is trying to defame my reputation. \\nJPMorgan Chase and its affiliate, XXXX XXXX behavior has been both unethical and discriminatory and is just one of the many reasons why they have an F- and D- rating respectively with the XXXX. It is also one of the reasons for their sordid reputation, as discussed online by tens of thousands of current and former customers. Additionally, this is one of the many reasons JPMorgan Chase been made to pay XXXX of dollars in fines and settlements for civil and criminal lawsuits, as well as been subjected to reprimands by Federal Bank Regulators, the US Federal Government, the US Department of Justice, various US Attorney Generals, and consumer watch groups, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\\n\\nTo settle this complaint, JPMorgan Chase can rightly remove my name from the XXXX MATCH List. Personally, I find it disgusting that a business located within the United States and governed by numerous state and federal laws can not only make false allegations against someone, like myself, but can also list them on the MATCH List. What makes it even more deplorable is the fact that neither XXXX XXXX nor JPMorgan Chase have any evidence that I did anything wrong. \\nDue to being unlawfully added to the MATCH List by JPMorgan Chase, I have been blackballed and discriminated against within the financial community. No bank located in the United States will allow me to obtain a merchant account for a minimum of five years. As outlined in this complaint, I have spent the past six months desperately trying to communicate with XXXX XXXX and JPMorgan Chase in an effort to resolve this unjust and illegal ban. All of the information reported in this complaint against JPMorgan Chase is 100 % true, complete, and accurate. Furthermore, supporting evidence, including written communications between myself, XXXX  XXXX, and JPMorgan Chase, is available.',\n",

There was absolutely no reason to close my account. They had no basis, other than race. I have a credit card with Chase with a XXXX credit limit. I always pay that card off to a XXXX balance when I use it. I did go into a Chase branch location and they did treat me a little differently because of my skin color. So I walked out. Then today I tried to log into my account and it was blocked. I called the bank and they could not give me any explanation on why they have closed the account. I feel Chase is discriminating against me because of my race. That is why they were having trouble explaining to me why they are closing my account. I had money in the account to that I will need return. My wife is a XXXX. She is going to refer me to another legal expert who's specialty is discrimination. I am very successful. I have money in different banks. The other banks where I hold my accounts don't discriminate against me because of the XXXX of my skin. Chase Bank has XXXX tendencies that need to be addressed. You can't treat the consumer this way. Chase could not give me one reason why they closed my account. Not one reason.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I opened a savings account on XX/XX/2019 with Chase Bank to earn a XXXX promotion bonus for a new savings account.  The only requirements were: 1) I had to deposit a total of XXXX or more in new money within 20 business days of account opening, and 2) I had to maintain at least a XXXX   balance for 90 days from the date of deposit.  Once these two requirements were met, Chase Bank would deposit XXXX  in my new account within 10 business days.I deposited XXXX into the new savings account onXX/XX/2019.  I transferred XXXX out of the account on XX/XX/2019, leaving XXXX in the account to avoid monthly service charges.  If you calculate the elapsed number of days fromXX/XX/2019 (NOTXX/XX/2019 when I made the deposit) to XX/XX/2019 (NOT the day I transferred the XXXX out of the account), you will find that I maintained a balance of XXXX in my Chase savings account for 90 days.  I called the customer support number to inquire about my missing XXXX bonus deposit and the call center rep stated that the system indicated I needed to keep the XXXX in the account one more day to earn the bonus.  She then stated that Chase Bank will not pay me the XXXX promotion bonus. Keep in mind that I am NOT including the day that I made the deposit (i.e. XX/XX/2019) in my 90 day calculation above, but it should be included, which would result in a period of 91 days that I maintained a balance ofXX/XX/XXXX in my Chase Bank savings account.I believe I have acted in good faith and met the requirements as set forth by Chase Bank.  If Chase Bank is calculating the 90 day period incorrectly for customers across the country, it could amount to a sizable sum not being paid to customers that are deserving of it.I have also filed this complaint with the OCC..',\n",

The last time they closed my oldest tradeline with no warning other than to say we sent a letter to you. I fought that issue and lost unfortunately. \\n\\nThis time, Chase is at it again. In regards to my account ending in XXXX, I spoke with three representatives who all said that they sent me a letter at the end of XXXX and that there was nothing else they can do. I have been escalating the issue further and further to climb up the ladder and maybe get this issue to a product manager who can actually make the decision to re establish an account.\\n\\nChase has made XXXX good faith effort to reach me as their customer to inform me of a serious matter of account closure. It is XXXX not XXXX, they have multiple methods of reaching out to a customer. I never received any postal correspondence from Chase and there is no real way to dispute that as there is no tracking information on a form letter sent through the post office. But Chase has my email address, my phone number and a secure messaging service on the online banking service. None of these methods were used to contact me to inform me of a serious issue regarding account closure. \\n\\nThis will again cause real meaningful harm to my credit as it will be a second long standing card that has been closed by the issuer. That is now a derogatory remark on my file and reduces the age of my credit and also increases the total utilization ratio of my credit report.',\n",

My employer filed for bankruptcy (XX/XX/20 ) and I am now on unemployment in the midst of the COVID19 madness. I called JPMC today ( XX/XX/2020 ) to inquire about options available to severely reduce my monthly payment including suspending interest given the COVID19 hardships I am suffering. \\n\\nThey offered three untenable options : 1. Balance Liquidation Program : Convert to a 60 monthly repayment plan with interest rates STARTING at 12 %. There is NO prepayment penalty. ( My response : I would be willing to do a 60 month plan at zero interest. ) 2. 90 Forbearance : No payment required for 90 days but interest continues to accrue at 14.24 % ( current rate ). ( My response : 90 forbearance would be helpful but NO interest should accrue and no fees incurred. ) 3. Settlement : Negotiate a payoff of the principal w their starting offer at 90 % of the {$14000.00} balance. ( My response : I am willing but unable to repay at this time. As such, I do not want to write down a balance. ) Given that we are in a zero interest environment and in the early days of a global pandemic and approaching 30 % unemployment in the US, I believe that it is tone deaf of JPMC to charge interest rates that were relevant pre-COVD19. \\n\\nI had a great call w my mortgage bank who is allowing 90 forbearance and will revisit terms in 90 days. They were totally empathetic, the opposite of JPMC. \\n\\nPlease help by suggesting a protocol for the industry for other consumers in the same situation as me. Thank you and stay safe.',\n",

Santander Consumer Financial USA, whereas third-party ownership voids my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Several of my old charges were never transferred to new ownership with written verification or validation, just a one page letter claiming that the original debt was sold. I am willing to settle on my old accounts that are still legitimately within the 6-year charge off timeline to enforce collections. However, I request a copy of the actual transfer rights of ownership. This is mandatory in any state or federal court jurisdiction where applicable. I also request the actual purchase price on transfer, which is only fair on any negotiated settlement.

I am entertaining a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy petition in the meantime, and will pull that trigger if there is no other alternative.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I have a variety of credit cards with Chase, including the Chase Sapphire Reserve card which is the card I used to cash in points with Chase Ultimate Rewards in order to purchase a flight. I used the Chase Ultimate Rewards website as well as spoke with a representative to confirm the purchase I was making. Specifically, I booked a flight with XXXX XXXX to fly from XXXX XXXX to XXXX, with a layover in XXXX. During the booking process I was prompted to inquire if I was interested in an upgrade to a higher class of seat. The upgrade that I was prompted to was for what XXXX XXXX refers to as Premium Coach. On the website, this explains that this upgrade includes extended legroom, upgraded meals, free alcohol, a free baggage check, and some additional features. I was most interested in the increased legroom and upgraded meals. I spoke with an Ultimate Rewards representative who confirmed these were included in the upgrade. Additionally, prior to the flight I contacted XXXX XXXX directly to confirm that myself, my wife, and my XXXX year old son were all seated together, and also to confirm that we had the upgraded seating arrangement. This was confirmed. I understood that a domestic flight would likely not include these perks, specifically the additional legroom and upgraded meals, but anticipated it would be included in the international flight. When we boarded our seats on the international flight, provided by XXXX XXXX ( an XXXX XXXX partner ) we noticed that we did not receive what we had purchased. The plane was actually quite old, it did not have any media at all nor any charging abilities, but most importantly it not only had no additional legroom but was actually one of the tightest seats I\\'ve ever sat in. We were also not provided any complimentary alcoholic drinks or upgraded meals ( this was actually the worst food I\\'ve ever received on a plane, which is saying a lot ). Needless to say this flight was very difficult for my family and we were very unhappy with the misrepresentation. When I contacted Chase Ultimate Rewards while overseas I was told there was nothing they would do, that I could not contact the airline directly, and that if I wanted to make any changes I would be required to pay for several change fees and that it would be cheaper just to buy a whole new flight home. I was ultimately able to change my flight on XXXX XXXX to the Premium Coach that I believed I had purchased in the first place at a cost of almost {$1900.00}. This seat was consistent with the research I had done regarding XXXX XXXX premium coach seating, including all the features indicated above. Since returning I have made several efforts to contact Chase both through representatives of Ultimate Rewards and representatives of the credit card itself. The response I received was not helpful. I was advised that I booked my flight in the main cabin, and basically that all the features they indicated on the website were only possibilities and only available if the flight itself had them as an option. I would submit that this is fraudulent advertising. First, it was not clearly shown that only some flights would offer these accommodations. Further, I\\'ve since learned that none of the XXXX XXXX flights via XXXX XXXX offer these types of accommodations. So there is no way that I actually could have received the accommodations that the website was advertising. Moreover, the last supervising representative ( XXXX from the Oklahoma Call Center ) was incredibly rude in saying that they would do nothing for me, that I was not entitled to any compensation, and that I had absolutely no recourse in my concerns. Prior to reaching XXXX on this same day I sat on hold for approximately an hour while another Supervisor claimed to be looking into the situation, then I was hung up on. When I spoke with XXXX he indicated there was no notes from that prior supervisor, and that the complaint was previously looked into and that he was not going to discuss my concerns. During this process I\\'ve waited on hold for no less than 5 hours while individuals claimed to be looking into my concerns then was disconnected without a return phone call. I believe that I should be compensated for the additional money I was required to spend to obtain the flight that I had originally bargained for. Even if not for the full amount, some compensation for the cash and hundreds of thousands of points would be appropriate. Moreover, while overseas I was attempting to use my priority pass card to access a lounge at the XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The priority pass number was not working and the international line to Chase Reserve was also not accepting my call. I was advised by the worker at the lounge that Chase Reserve would reimburse me since one of my benefits of the card is access to the lounge. I spent approximately {$97.00} gaining access to the lounge. When I contacted Chase upon my return, I was told that I had previously been reimbursed and that this is only a one time thing. Chase was referring to XX/XX/XXXX when I first acquired the card and was told by Chase just to use my Reserve card at the lounge and they would reimburse me. I was also told that I could use it on both my outgoing and return flight with no problem. At that time I was never advised that this was a one time offer. Now I\\'m being told that they will not reimburse this expense, and that I should have read the finite details in my credit card contract that explained these rules. I believe that based on the Chase agent \\'s prior consideration and failure to explain this \" one time \\'\\' rule, they have waived any contractual language to deny this. But more importantly, this is indicative of Chase \\'s unwillingness to do the right thing by their customers. While I have no doubt that Chase could not care less about me as a customer, I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on my various Chase cards and feel that I have been scammed as a customer. In both of these situations, Chase took advantage of me by failing to disclose that which was readily apparent at the time, and then rudely refusing to provide me with any recourse.',\n",

Tues XX/XX/XXXX, i checked the bank, no credit was issued, i call the fraud dept back, they then tell me, there is nothing they can do because the charges are \" pending \\'\\' on the account, they can only issue a credit if the charges have \" posted \\'\\'. I then called XXXX, spoke to a manager, she stated there is nothing they can do about the pending charges, it is on my bank. XXXX did offer to write a letter to chase to explain the order was canceled ... Chase bank refused the letter ... so now this is day 3, my account is still negative, i have no debit card, i cant buy my children food nor diapers ...

I currently bank at the following location : Chase Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WI XXXX XXXX. \\nI have a personal and business account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I entered the bank between XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The purpose of my visit was to get a replacement for my debit card. I noticed a seat near the window was vacate and decided to sit down and wait for some assistance. There was a male sitting next to me and a female employee working near the window. The man was waiting for assistance. We made eye contact. He had a disapproving look in his eyes and quickly diverted his eyes elsewhere. \\n\\nI continued to wait even after the man sitting next to me was assisted. After waiting several minutes more, another customer came in and sat on my right side. It was then that XXXX XXXX, a private client banker, came out of his office. He approached the guy sitting to my right and asked him if he needed any help. I immediately got up and asked Mr. XXXX when I was going to be assisted. I pointed out to Mr. XXXX that I had been waiting for assistance. I went on to ask him, \" Why you ignore me? I was here before this guy? \\'\\' Mr. XXXX responded, \" Oh, no, I\\'m talking to you now. \\'\\' I responded to him by saying,, \\'\\' No, You\\'re talking to this guy. \\'\\' Finally he said, \" Ok, Ok. Come into my office. \\'\\' It was then I finally got service. At XXXX XXXX, I was finally able to get a new debit card. I kept wondering how much longer I would have been waiting if they guy hadn\\'t come in. \\n\\nI returned to the bank on XX/XX/2019 between noon and XXXX XXXX to complain about what happened on XX/XX/2019. Mr. XXXX was working alone and recognized me from the previous day. I asked him if I could talk to the boss and he said that he was the boss. I went on to ask him, \" How can I complaint against you? \\'\\' He never gave the information on how to file a complaint. It became clear that I wasn\\'t going to get anywhere with him so I left and decided that I would return on Monday in homes of getting the information necessary on how to file a complaint. \\n\\nI returned to the bank on XX/XX/2019 and talked to a teller. I gave her my contact information. She forwarded the information to XXXX XXXX, Branch Manager and Vice President, via email. Mr. XXXX called me on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX and left a message. I missed the call and wasn\\'t able to get the message. \\n\\nI decided to return to the bank on XX/XX/2019 in the afternoon. I gave the teller my email address so that Mr. XXXX could email me instead of calling me and so we could come up with resolution. \\n\\nMr. XXXX and I met on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX. During the meeting, Mr. XXXX informed me that he couldn\\'t provide any assistance because it was a different department. He didn\\'t give me the name and contact information of the department to complain to. When the issue gets investigated, there is amply security footage that was recorded on XX/XX/2019. I could easily tell there are several security cameras watching everything that happens in the bank.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'This is concerning an XXXX  Rewards Card by Chase. This past summer I either lost this card or had my pocket picked in XXXX, Ala and over the next month somebody used this card to charge almost {$2000.00} to this account. First of all Chase should have contacted me as this is so unlike my spending habit for the length that we have had this card and they continued to allow and accept charges after they exceeded my credit limit. The facts are detailed below : On XX/XX/XXXX we spent the night in XXXX, XXXX  and the next day on the XXXX we hit the road enroute to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, traveling down XXXX XXXX and we stopped for gas at a XXXX XXXX  gas/convenience store, filled up and hit the road. It was while here that my card went missing, although I was not aware of it until a couple of months later. We usually do not use this card a lot, and I had no plans to use it for anything else during our trip ( we typically use XXXX XXXX for most of our travel expenses ) so thus I did not miss the XXXX Rewards card. We continued on down to XXXX XXXX for a few days, then over to XXXX, XXXX , XXXX XXXX and then back home to XXXX, XXXX  where we arrived back home on XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nAt this point I still did not notice my card missing as I had no reason to look for it. I do not receive a hard copy of my bill, just receiving an e-mail notification that my bill is ready to be paid which just shows minimum payment and balance owed and if those figures are close to what I expect I never open up my account to view the statement. So I got my statement ( believe that would have been XXXX ) closing date was XX/XX/XXXX and that statement had the first fraudulent charge of {$9.00} made at XXXX  XXXX   in XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Because the amount was so low the balance owed was within the range that I figured it should have been so thus I never opened up the account to look at charges. But the next month was a different story, on my statement which closed XX/XX/XXXX there were charges totaling almost {$1700.00} and taking me {$160.00} over my credit limit. I was in shock and I panicked and called Chase right away to report this. In hindsight I should have waited a little bit to cool down and get myself under control but I knew we could not afford to take a hit like this. We are retired XXXX  XXXX and did not handle it well. When I originally called Chase I was convinced that we were victims of a thing I had seen on the news called skimmers that criminals put on gas pumps to steal your credit card information. I am almost XXXX years old and never had lost a credit card before and when they asked me if I still had my card I said yes I did, but I was wrong. I did see a card lying on my desk which I found out later was my wifes, mine has still never been seen since XX/XX/XXXX when I used it for gas in XXXX, XXXX At that time Chase removed these that I said were fraudulent charges from my account. However later when their investigation showed that the actual card was used to make these charges, these fraudulent charges were put back on my account and my fraud claim was denied. When I realized that my card had been used and realized it was missing I called the XXXX police department spoke to an Officer XXXX XXXX, XXXX on XXXX XXXX and filed a police report. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from Investigator XXXX with the XXXX police department and he asked me if I could fax him copies of the credit card statements which I did the next day on XXXX XXXX. All told it looks like between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX there were 32 fraudulent charges in XXXX totaling {$1800.00}. This is so unlike my credit card usage ever, I doubt if I have ever had this many charges in a year on any credit card I own except XXXX XXXX and should have been picked up and at least questioned by Chase fraud department plus allowing charges to exceed my credit limit by like {$300.00}. \\n\\nBottom line is penalizing us solely because I was wrong, I misspoke when asked if I still had the card but it my opinion that does not justify putting the hardship on us to pay for these fraudulent charges. My integrity is impecible. I retired after spending 38 yrs with the XXXX  XXXX  as a XXXX XXXX for the XXXX XXXX XXXX, an arm of the XXXX XXXX  and as such had signature authority to obligate funds on behalf of the XXXX. When I retired my boss gave a talk at my retirement luncheon in which she said that I had more integrity than any XXXX XXXX she has ever seen or worked with. I stand by that integrity. I am also a XXXX Veteran and served this nation with honor then I have Chase want to treat us like this. Chase likes to say that you are never responsible for fraud with Chase. This is fraud pure and simple, I did not authorize these charges, did not give permission to use our credit card. Uncalled for and I respectively ask that you intervene in this matter. The person we spoke to at Chase was XXXX, XXXX, extension XXXX. Thank you XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ohio XXXX XXXX XXXX',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Ive opened a savings and a time deposit account with Chase bank around 3 years ago, as advised by the banker I open the savings account with minimum balance of {$300.00} that wont trigger any service fee. Couple months later I closed the time deposit account and keep the savings account without touching it for the last 3 years and today when I approach the branch to close my savings account and was told the balance remaining only {$190.00} due to monthly service charge of below minimum balance I was surprised I did not touch this account since opened with a minimum balance how came for charged? I was told theres a {$8.00} fee charge to my account one day which trigger the minimum balance lower, but that {$8.00} was refunded to my account a year later! But the balance still requires service fee. I asked since they refund the unauthorized charge of {$8.00} which meant my account should never falls below {$300.00} in the beginning they should refund all the service charge to me but they refuse the reason is because its too long ago. I totally felt I got fooled by a bank, how can I save money in an account resulted in losing money which I hardly conduct any withdrawal, no protection on consumer big bank like Chase make lots of money by eating on my savings. I was forced to close my account to avoid further loss with a remaining balance of {$190.00} only, lost 33 % but would strongly wish you can help me to get my money back. Today is XX/XX/2019',\n",

THE REP PUT IN THE SYSTEM SAYING THAT I SAID WE ARE RUNNING PEOPLE CHECKS WITHOUT THERE PERMISSION. WHICH I NEVER SAID ANYTHING CLOSE TO THAT. AND WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT AT ALL. THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE, I EVEN EXPLAIN TO THE REP THAT WE HAVE ALL OUR CLIENTS SIGN A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT TO PROTECT US FROM THINGS LIKE THIS. I DONT KNOW WHAT SHE PUT IN THE SYSTEM BUT THEN SHE TRANSFERRED TO SOMEONE WHO I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND, DUE TO A STRONG ACCENT. SHE JUST SAID WE HAVE TO CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT AND WE CANT TELL YOU WHY. THEN SHE HUNG UP ON ME. LATELY WE HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF OUR CLIENTS PAYING WHAT THEY OWE FOR SERVICES RENDERED. DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS SPREAD OUR COMPANY HAS BEEN STRUGGLING WAY MORE THEN USUAL, BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN THE SAME AND WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING MORE BOUNCED CHECKS LATELY. NOT A WHOLE LOT BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FIXING THE PROBLEM. BUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE ARE PANICKING. THIS IS NOT OUR FAULT THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND ITS NOT OUR FAULT IF CHECKS BOUNCE. THIS IS THE NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CHASE SHOULD EXCEPT THE FACT THAT THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO BE NORMAL FOR A WHILE. CHASE SHOULD BE MORE UNDERSTANDING TO WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACTS SIGNED BY OUR CLIENTS AND THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE PROCEDURES WHEN VIOLATING THEIR CONTRACT AGREEMENT. I CAN PROVIDE PROOF. THIS HAS ONLY BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS. CHASE SHOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH US ON GETTING THIS ISSUE FIXED, RATHER THEN CLOSING MY ACCOUNTS SO FAST WITH NO VALID REASONS. WE CAN NOT RISK GOING OUT AND GETTING SICK TO OPEN A NEW CHECKING ACCOUNT SOMEWHERE ELSE. PLUS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM THE SBA, WE ARE STILL WAITING. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO STAY A FLOAT. THIS IS NOT FAIR THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS. ALSO, THEY HAVE HELD ALL OF OUR FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNTS SO WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY OUR EMPLOYERS OR PAY OUR BILLS. I HAVE ASK FOR THEM NOT TO SHUT OUR ACCOUNT DOWN OR HOLD OUR FUNDS. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THEM TO DO THIS. THE REP ON THE PHONE PUT IN INCORRECT INFO AND NOW WE ARE SUFFERING FOR IT. WE WILL FOR SURE NOW GO OUT OF BUSINESS IF THEY DON'T GIVE BACK OUR MONEY SOON. THEY ARE MESSING WITH PEOPLE LIVELY HOOD. I WOULD LIKE TO RESOLVE THIS WITHOUT THE ACCOUNTS CLOSING. PLEASE HELP US TO GET THIS RESOLVED SO WE CAN GO BACK TO BUSINESS. THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH THIS. PLEASE HELP.CHASE BUSINESS CHECKING ACCOUNT # XXXX AND XXXX\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"In XXXX, 2019, we negotiated our second car lease with XXXX XXXX XXXX. We negotiated this monthly lease to include all of the upgrades that were included in our prior lease and more. We also negotiated that our milages overage be paid by the dealership, since the delay of delivery restricted us from taking advantage of the two month lease pay-off lease program that was running at the time. Upon delivery of our car in XXXX, 2019, we noticed that we were missing some of the upgrades as promised and confirmed via email in XXXX, 2019. We immediately contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and reported the fraudulent missing upgrades, since they were included in our negotiated monthly lease payment. Since we did not hear back from anyone, we emailed XXXX XXXX, the General Sales Manager. After contacting XXXX XXXX regarding the missing upgrades, we received email correspondence requesting a photo of the missing upgrades. We were dumbfounded, since you can not takes pictures of something that does not exist. Upon submitting the complaint regarding the missing upgrades, we started experiencing multiple mechanical problems with our car. We also received email correspondence from Mr. XXXX, who fraudulently stated that XXXX XXXX no longer offer those specific upgrades anymore. This was a false and fraudulent statement made by Mr. XXXX, since we contacted the XXXX XXXX Corporate Office and confirmed on a recorded line that those specific upgrades were in fact still offered in XXXX XXXX. Our car was flat bedded to the XXXX XXXX XXXX dealership and then returned to us with multiple issues not corrected and the leather covering to the two front seats unattached around the base of the seats. We emailed XXXX XXXX XXXX immediately regarding the same mechanical problems still existing and we were then requested to take a photo or video of the problems/issues with the vehicle. We then started getting harassing calls from Chase Bank, stating we owed {$6000.00} in mileage overage and were never sent any statement in regards to this payment request. Chase Bank not only unlawfully disclosed all of XXXX XXXX 's financial information, but then threatened me that if it wasn't paid that they would seek legal action. We also signed a document which stated there was no money due at the time of the lease trade. We then contacted the XXXX XXXX Corporate Office to file a complaint regarding the mileage overage charge, the fraudulent lease negotiations and the multiple mechanical issues. XXXX  XXXX Corporate confirmed that they spoke with the General Manager of the dealership, XXXX XXXX and that I needed to contact the dealership directly. XXXX XXXX, who is the General Sales Manager and not the GM contacted XXXX  XXXX and fraudulently acted on behalf of the actual General Manager of the dealership on recorded lines. When speaking to the actual GM, XXXX XXXX, he requested that I forward my email correspondence with XXXX XXXX to him directly. On that same call with XXXX XXXX it was agreed upon that I would not be corresponding with XXXX XXXX at all anymore. After sending my email correspondence via email to XXXX XXXX, I received a phone call on my business line from XXXX XXXX with a very threatening tone telling me that I need to take my business elsewhere. I then sent an email to XXXX XXXX explaining the tone and vernacular of XXXX XXXX 's call to me and informed him that due to XXXX XXXX 's threatening tone all future correspondence will take place via email correspondence and requested an explanation for Mr. XXXX 's threatening behavior and how this situation was going to be rectified with no response. I also confirmed with XXXX XXXX that the Autobiography  has all of the upgrade options we have been paying for and we given a lesser model.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I am a U.S. citizen who is living XXXX in XXXX under a SOFA agreement, as I am a XXXX with the U.S. military. I am having issues with my credit card company, Chase, on a dispute I submitted. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2018, I submitted an order to a XXXX dealership ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a third party XXXX dealership ) that specializes in selling XXXX  to U.S. military members or those under the SOFA agreement. I put a {$5000.00} \" deposit \\'\\' for the order using my Chase XXXX XXXX credit card. I signed an \" Order Quotation \\'\\' as well as a \" General Consent \\'\\' document in regards to this, and I intended the {$5000.00} to be used when the auto loan would be dispursed after the card was made. \\n\\nHowever, a couple weeks after this I learned that this particular dealership had mishandled my vehicle order by not having my {$5000.00} go through the V.A.T. (  value added tax ) free program that is in place between the XXXX and U.S. government. Due to this, if I were to receive the order, XXXX customs could seize the vehicle until I paid 19 % taxes on the vehicle. The \" Order Quotation \\'\\' I signed did not include this tax amount, and so the \" General Consent \\'\\' that was signed should be broken because the agreed upon price would now be changed. In addition, the agreed upon delivery date was going to be missed by more than 6 weeks ( another stipulation of the \" General Consent \\'\\' that could cause the order to be cancelled ). Finally, I never signed a \" Bill of Sale \\'\\' for the vehicle so I am not legally beholden to the order or the vehicle. \\n\\nAll of these issues and more caused me to cancel the vehicle order on XX/XX/2018. The dealership refused to acknowledge my proof of wrongdoing on their part, and proceeded to threaten me by insisting they would keep my {$5000.00}, attempt to pursue me for 15 % of the vehicle \\'s value in fees, and send me to collections. The dealership was standoffish and refused to provide me with any proof of my wrong doing or any counter proof with what I had presented to them. \\n\\nI contacted the U.S. VAT Free program head here in XXXX who agrees that the dealership mishandled the order ; I also contacted XXXX HQ who further concurred that the dealership misled me and should return the money. However, since they are a third party dealership, they could not force them to do so. I have hired a XXXX lawyer to handle this case and the dealerships lawyers have ignored all legal communications and so I am taking them to small claims court over this. \\n\\nThe reason for my complaint is due to my credit cards handling of the dispute on the {$5000.00}. I contacted my credit card company, Chase, to initiate a dispute on the charge. I submitted all of my proof ( e-mail chains, documents signed, policy letters, etc. ) to them. Initially, Chase provided me with a $ XXXX credit in approximately XX/XX/2018. They stipulated that this was dependent on two billing cycles for the merchant to refute the dispute. \\n\\nThe dealership waited the two months before countering, which caused Chase to place the charges back on my credit card statement. Chase not once notified me of their decision or consulted with me on the issue. I called into chase multiple times over multiple hours trying to find out why the charge had been placed back on my statement. \\n\\nChases \\' response shocked me. They stated that because the merchant had produced a policy, they would always adhere to the merchants policy and would not take into account the documentation and proof of how the policy was broken. This meant that even though the dealership had mistreated the order and broken several rules, Chase would not investigate the issue further. They thus saddled me with the {$5000.00} charge again without consulting me first, they did not provide me any documentation in regards to my proof of wrong doing, and they did not provide me with any documentation that the merchant might havep rovided them. \\n\\nIn addition, they mistakenly placed a {$4900.00} charge in addition to the {$5000.00} on my statement which caused me to have to call in for over 5 hours until they figured out that the {$4900.00} was erroneous on their part and corrected it. \\n\\nAs such, I am required to take this issue to court in order to get a resolution. I understand this necessity, however I would like to file a complaint about Chases \\' handling of the issue. They are not on the consumer \\'s side it seems and are not using evidence of wrongdoing to provide protection from merchant \\'s malpractice. \\n\\nThank you for your time.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Hello. I am so frustrated. I have been a member of Chase bank ( or its prior owners ) for almost 40 years. Every month I deposit checks of {$4000.00} - {$6000.00} to cover my bills and auto payments. On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a {$5000.00} check and received written confirmation that the funds would be totally available on XXXX. My mortgage payment drafted on XXXX and Chase sent me notification that they decided to place a 10 day hold on this check. They bounced my mortgage check. I tried to call and waited 3 hours on Friday XXXX and finally hung up. I tried again later that day and hung up after 2 hours. I tried to find a place online, but they said they wouldn't return email messages for at least 7 days. Today ( XXXX ) I woke up and called and after 45 minutes got a real person. She was sympathetic but told me it wasn't her department and transferred me to the check hold number. She also gave me the direct number ( thankfully ) After 50 minutes I was bounced off the call. I am currently 55 minutes in to my next hold ( they said 15 minutes ). The money was drafted from my checking account on XXXX and now I have no access to these funds and nobody to talk to. My mortgage has been bounced and any other drafts cant be stopped at this point, so will likely also be bounced. I cant believe they can send me notice that the funds will be available on XXXX, and then change their minds? \\nXXXX XXXX\",\n",

I contacted Chase, requested to opt out and keep the current 9.24 % rate. I was advised at that time if I opt out, the account would be closed. I agreed to close the account and retain the current interest rate of 9.24 %. The account was closed at the interest rate remained at 9.24 % as agreed. \\nXX/XX/XXXX The XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$130.00} was returned in error.

My current interest rate should be 9.24 % not the current 21.49 %. \\nThis letter is to request my account credited for {$2200.00} over charge in interest the past 4 years. A spreadsheet is attached detailing the month by month over charge. \\n**************************************************** Chase Response XXXX : Hello XXXX, We received your message disputing the interest charges on the account ending in XXXX. \\nXXXX, your account had a variable annual percentage rate ( APR ) based on the U.S. Prime Rate. Hence, the periodic increase in the APR. Please note that there was not an error with the APR on the account, and the account didn\\'t qualify for a courtesy refund. \\nWe appreciate your understanding in this matter. \\nHere \\'s what you need to know about variable APRs : - The APR may increase or decrease each month if the\\n\\nU.S. Prime Rate changes. - If the APR increas\\nes, you will pay a higher interest charge and may pay a higher minimum payment. \\nHere \\'s how we calculate your variable APR : - We add a margin to the highest U.S. Prime Rate published in the Money Rates section of The XXXX XXXX XXXX two business days ( not weekends or federal holidays ) before the closing date shown on your billing statement. \\n- We apply the new rate the first day of your billing cycle in which the Prime Rate changed. \\n- The Prime Rate is simply a reference index and is not the lowest interest rate available. \\n- If the XXXX XXXX XXXX stops publishing the Prime Rate we will select a similar reference rate. \\nWe value your relationship with us, and we hope that the information we provided is helpful. \\nYour Cardmember Agreement explains your full account terms. \\nPlease contact us anytime with questions or concerns. We are here to help and are committed to providing you excellent service. \\nThank you for choosing Chase. \\n******************************************************* XXXX Response : Date : XXXX XXXX To : Chase Card Services Subject : Re : Fees/Interest Charges Message : Did you even read my letter? Yes, the rates are variable. However I received a letter from Chase to \" opt out \\'\\' which included closing the account and paying the remaining balance until paid at the 9.24 %. Also, I did not say there was an \" error with the APR \\'\\'. Please forward this to someone that is knowledgeable on the regulatory requirements of the Credit Card act including \" opt out \\'\\'. I am forwarding this letter to the BCFP ( formally CFPD ) also because clearly Chase system is not designed to accommodate the opt out changes. \\n\\n********************************************** Chase Response Date : XXXX XXXX From : Chase Card Services Subject : Re : Fees/Interest Charges Message : Hello XXXX, Thank you for contacting Chase with your concerns about the increase in the Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ) on your Chase Ink Cash Business account. I am sorry as your inquiry wasn\\'t completely answered by our previous email. \\nXXXX, your inquiry has been escalated. I understand that you rejected the change in terms and your account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. With your business card, when you do not make your minimum payment by the due date, the default APR apply. The default APRs would apply to all outstanding balances and future transactions on your account. \\nCertain situations, such as late payments, a past due status, an over-limit condition, a returned payment, or any other default reason contained in your Cardmember Agreement ( CMA ) may cause your account to move to a higher APR ( even after account closure due to rejection of change in terms ). If your APR changes, we\\'ll notify you by mail, and the new rate will start 45 days after we send you a notification. So, if you miss any payments or if the account is past due, your APR can increase on a business card. This is where a business credit card is different when compared to a personal credit card. \\nOur records show that because of late payments in the year XXXX, your purchase variable APR was increased from 9.24 % to 14.24 % and then to 19.24 %. Subsequent increase in the Prime Rate by the Federal Reserve has resulted in a further increase in your APR and it is currently at 21.49 % variable. So, please be assured that the interest which we have charged you over the years is correct and has been calculated according to the terms of the business cardmember agreement. \\nI hope I was able to clarify this for you. If you would like to discuss this further, please call us at the customer service number mentioned below. Thank you for your business with us. \\nThank you, XXXX Chase Email Servicing XXXX XXXX : XXXX',\n",

Due to COVID I was unable to contact my bank to notify until XXXX - I did this first thing in the morning along with all credit / XXXX / everything. I figured I was good, I didn\\'t see any strange transactions on my bank. on XXXX at XXXX I got a text alert that my account balance had dropped to {$0.00}. I checked my bank app and saw a withdrawal for {$490.00}, along with a suspicious deposit of {$1900.00}. I called the bank immediately to advise this is fraud and why / how could this happen when my account was alerted as \" Compromised Identity and fraud \\'\\' on XXXX i wasn\\'t able to get through to anyone I sat on hold x2 for 2.5 hours only to be hung up on. I wasn\\'t able to see the slips on XXXX as they were still in a Pending status. at XXXX on XXXX i was able to open and look at them. I called chase again and got Fraud about XXXX MST. My account was \" locked \\'\\' or placed on hold. The man i talked to said he could see the signatures on the slips and check from XXXX did NOT match my previous slips and this was indeed fraud. I was transferred to Claims and I filed for my money to be returned. As of today XX/XX/15 I still do not have my money back. I told the bank that I had transferred all remaining funds to my savings account to protect the money from the people she stole this check from. My bank returned the check to the XXXX ( Fraud check deposit ) My account was then Negative {$2000.00}. I was still pending my money to be returned, when i talked to claims I gave them all three police numbers and was told that they wouldn\\'t investigate of give me my money back until I sent them copies of the police report. After this I filed a complaint with the executive office XXXX. Yesterday I called after not hearing back on the status of my account, what is going on, why hasnt the video footage be given to the police ... I was told I was going to get a call back. I received a letter that I was also being charged for the fraud check?? even though I reported it. I had {$100.00} in my savings account ( Prior to this mess ) and told the executive that they would need to transfer all but the {$100.00} and when they finally put back my {$490.00} the account will balance out but they need to put the money remaining in to my new account that the XXXX branch did NOT assist me in opening. I looked today ( XX/XX/15 ) and my savings account is GONE, all money was transferred to that overdrawn account. I learned that my Stimulus is going to be deposited to the account that is on hold, but I can not get a call back, if I am going to receive that or what exactly is going on. \\n\\nI just checked the letter on my chase app and apparently they are saying I authorized this transaction on XXXX WHICH I DID NOT!! I can PROVE I was working and NEVER in XXXX!!!!! \\nThis bank ASSISTED in commiting Fraud and I am still being Victimized!!!',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Back in mid XXXX of XXXX, i became aware that my bank account with Chase bank was overdrawn by a well over {$400.00}. As i took the time to go over my transactions on my account, i was aware of multiple ACH transactions that was taken out of my account from XXXX dated all the way back to XXXX of XXXX. I was not aware of these transactions because most of them hit my account within a couple weeks of each other in XXXX. Once i went over all the transactions that i was not aware of, i immediately contacted Chase Bank and XXXX XXXX department to dispute these transactions on my account. I gave them each transaction that i was not aware of and they filed the dispute and was told that they both would do an investigation. While Chase did their investigation, i was told i would temporarily receive those funds back to the account. I was also told that they would freeze the account so nothing else could be done with that account and to go into my home branch when possible and set up a new account. \\n\\nAround XX/XX/XXXX, i went into a Chase Bank location to set up a new account and spoke with a branch rep who set up a new account for me and also contacted the Chase fraud department to see what the status was with the dispute. He was told that he had to give me a form to fill out regarding the claim and fax it back to them so they can finish the investigation. He gave me the form and i filled it out and that form was faxed to the fraud department along with a printed ledger of the transactions in dispute. He mentioned that i should see the funds back on my new account in a couple of days. \\n\\nA week went by and I did not hear back from the branch or the fraud department regarding the investigation and the funds being returned back to me. So i decided to give the fraud department a call to see what the status was. And to my surprise, i was told that the investigation was still active, but due to a \" 60 day rule \\'\\' that Chase bank has regarding disputes, i would not be getting the bulk of my money. The only amount i would get back was {$37.00}. I was told that because of this rule, they only return funds from 60 days of the first transaction that was deemed fraudulent. After hearing this, i immediately went back to the Chase bank and spoke with the branch manager. After speaking with him for well over XXXX hours, he told me he was aware of this \" rule \\'\\' but based on the transactions that was submitted to the Chase fraud department, he didnt understand why they went all the way back to XXXX of XXXX, when the ledger submitted to Chase started with the first transaction in XX/XX/XXXX, which would have been within the 60 day rule that the fraud department was referring to. \\n\\nWell after getting nowhere with the fraud department, i was told by the branch manager to contact XXXX to make sure that they was aware of the fraud. I told the manager i have already called XXXX, but have not heard anything back from them. I told the manager that i will contact them again since they gave me a case number regarding the dispute. After waiting over an hour to get them on the line, and after hours of trying to get a direct answer from XXXX, they finally told me that they determined that the transactions were fraudulently taken from my Chase account and used by a person overseas XXXX  account. They also told me that they closed that persons account and reversed those funds back to the my Chase account. I called back the branch manager at the bank and let him know what i was told by XXXX, and he said that i should see the funds back on the account in about a week at the latest. \\n\\nWeeks have gone by and i did not see any funds returned back except the {$37.00} mentioned earlier. I called the branch manager back again to see what the status was, and he called his team and told me he does not see any funds reversed back from XXXX. So after days of going back and forth with XXXX and Chase, i finally got them both on the line at the same time so they could speak with each other to fix this. XXXX confirmed with Chase that the funds were indeed fraudulent and that they confirmed that the funds were sent back to the account. This was in early XXXX i had this call with both of them on the line. \\n\\nIt is now XX/XX/XXXX. After multiple calls to Chase and XXXX, i have not received my funds back from Chase bank and i have also stop hearing from the branch manager. I called today and finally got him to take my call. He mentioned that he was still waiting on the fraud team on his end. So now i am behind on multiple bills and rent due to this situation as i unfortunately live paycheck to paycheck. I was given this site by a family member to contact in hopes maybe something can be done.',\n",

We received a case number with that complaint. \\n\\nThe OCC verbally informed us on today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that our complaint was referred to CFPB ; however, the representative from CFPB had no records of our complaint ; therefore we are filing our complaint directly with CFPB. \\n\\nWe are filing a complaint for discrimination based on Race and/or Color. We strongly believe Chase Bank violated our rights to credit, according to the protective - provisions provided in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in any type of credit transaction, including applying for, or extending credit to small businesses based on race. Furthermore, Chase Bank has not presented us with a letter of declination or any reason for denying us credit. \\n\\nOur complaints stem from the lending laws that prohibit discrimination, disparate treatment and disparate impact under Tit\\n\\nle VII of the Civil Rights Act and in accordance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ).

I decided to reopen my chase card.

I call chase again for further clarification, was told my statement date ended on XX/XX/XXXX. Which leaves me even more confused. ( How can a statement account close, in less than 30 days of it opening? ) Nor was I ever informed statement close date -until it was reported to credit bureaus. \\n\\n*My wife and brother-in-law both have chase cards 9 total and both having closing date at least 30 days of the original opening date furthermore my brother-in-law opened the same type of card the same day as me but his closing date was 30 day while mine was 2 weeks from opening. \\n\\nThe representative stated my closing date going forward is the XXXX of every month. \\nSecond Issue : My account closes with a negative balance of ( {$0.00} ) on XX/XX/XXXX.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"This message is dated XX/XX/2020. On XX/XX/2020, we initiated a mortgage refinance application with our current primary residence mortgage lender ( JP Morgan Chase Bank ) based upon a solicitation letter from them that indicated we could lower our mortgage rate from a current rate of 4.00 % to 3.125 % ( and an estimated APY of 3.204 % ). At that time, our current mortgage balance ( account number XXXX ) was approximately {$580000.00}. After immediately contacting Chase to refinance, we were told that the offered interest rate of 3.125 % was no longer available. However, we were offered and subsequently accepted a Lock-in Agreement ( also issued on XX/XX/2020 ), for a 30-year, fixed rate mortgage of {$580000.00} at 3.49 % with discount points of ( .039 % ), essentially representing a no-cost refinance. Despite feeling like Chase had just pulled a bait-and-switch on us by offering us 3.125 % and then rescinding it in favor of 3.49 %, we decided that we would still proceed with them since this should merely be a very simple, streamlined rate-and-term refinance of a performing loan already in their portfolio. We immediately executed a Lock-in Agreement. That Lock-in Agreement has an expiration date of XX/XX/2020, so at the time of this writing that Lock-in Agreement has not yet expired. \\n\\nAnyway, after the electronic delivery by us of considerable personal financial information to Chase through their employee XXXX XXXX ( Executive Mortgage Banker - NMLS ID : XXXX ), all communication from Mr. XXXX ceased approximately a week ago. Beginning at that time, Chase ' website began indicating that our mortgage application was no longer active. We have been instructed to download our application documents if we want to keep copies for our records. Presumably, Chase has decided to decline our refinance application without any written or verbal notice. Several email and phone messages to Mr. XXXX have gone unanswered ; Chase has been equally non-responsive.\\n\\nFor reference, we have a strong FICO score of XXXX, and a spotless payment history with Chase. The refinance in question would have significantly lowered our current monthly mortgage payment with Chase. Furthermore, the appraised value of our home as part of this application came in significantly higher that at origination. Simply stated, the actual credit risk associated with our current situation is considerably stronger than at origination. If anything, Chase would have been in a more secure credit risk position that when this loan had been originated. Consequently, we fail to see any basis for what amounts to a decline of our mortgage refinance application. \\n\\nAt this point, if in fact our refinance application has been declined, in order to feel as if we have been made whole, at a minimum we would like Chase to refund to us the {$500.00} appraisal fee that they initiated - and for which we had to prepay. However, to feel fully vindicated, it is our opinion that Chase should honor their original refinance offer of 3.125 % ( APY 3.204 % ) as presented to us in their original offer letter. At the very least, Chase should deliver on their Lock-in Agreement for a loan of {$580000.00} on a 30-year fixed rate at 3.49 % with ( .039 % ) discount points ; yet to expire on XX/XX/2020.\",\n",

She then reached out to the fraud department and they confirmed the action by the bank and that they would not give me reason for their action and the action is irreversible. \\nI am an XXXX XXXX  and an XXXX in the XXXX XXXX and I think this is very discriminatory to say the least because I have pulled my credit report from the three major credit bureaus and there was no derogatory or adverse findings on my report. \\nI would therefore be grateful if Chase Bank can provide reasons why they closed my account without telling me the rationale behind their actions. \\nI request more explanations for their actions so that if I were a victim of identity theft I can take necessary steps to secure myself and I also would appreciate it if they can restore my accounts. \\nThank you so much and I look forward to hearing from you soon. \\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out to me if you need further information or clarification. \\nSincerely, XXXX',\n",

Before I placed the order, I checked my XXXX Chase credit card limit, and I only had {$180.00} left, so I wasn't going to order until I could deposit some money and pay down my bill, but on the checkout page, there was an option to break the total amount into 18 equal payment of $ XXXX per month. So I checked the box and placed the order, expecting to see a charge of the first month 's amount. Instead, I was billed the full amount on my XXXX Chase credit card, which removed the last of my remaining credit, and caused me to exceed my credit limit. No doubt, I would have had penalties, but as soon as I saw the charge notification, I called Chase, who tranferred me to XXXX, and I cancelled the order. Chase then assured me that everything was corrected, and was back to the way it was previosly. ( We'll see ) When talking to the Chase person, she said that while they offered 18 months split up into equal, interest free payments, it actually was implemented as 18 months of an interest free loan - which is not the same thing at all. In fact, the person I was talking to at Chase said that she very recently took advantage of the same offer, only to find out that she too was billed for the full amount, to her surprise. \\nBeing able to pay in 18 installments is not the same as being charged the full amount interest free for 18 months. And how would that work? How would they separate this charge, at zero percent interest rate, from other charges? No doubt, they would find a way to profit from the 'no interest ' loan. \\nThey could have easily called it an 18 month interest free loan, but chose to make a misleading statement.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voice mail message from an alleged computer repair company, telling me if I didn\\'t contact them that day, another year \\'s subscription would be charged to my credit card, of {$290.00}. I\\'ve signed up with these companies in the past, so it was possible that they were legitimate. I called them ; they said I had a {$200.00} refund coming. They asked for me to allow XXXX access on my computer so they could do a final \" repair \\'\\' of my computer and delete all the viruses, etc. I\\'d done this before with other companies, so I allowed it. They said they couldn\\'t credit the {$200.00} to my credit card so I allowed them to credit the {$200.00} to my checking account. During that process, \" accidentally \\'\\' the sum of {$20000.00} had been deposited into my checking account by their company instead of {$200.00}. I was shown the sum which was actually in my checking account. The man I was talking to, XXXX, phone number XXXX, said there was a mistake and asked me to go to my credit union and wire them {$19000.00}, to JP Morgan Chase Bank, to the name of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NY, XXXX ; Account No. XXXX because they had accidentally overpaid me from the {$200.00} they said I had coming. I did so. \\n\\nAll this time, over about a week \\'s interval, the company XXXX allegedly worked for was supposedly working on my computer ; I was asked a number of times not to get on it while they were working on it, and a couple of times I was told I could get on it but not to do any banking because my security software wasn\\'t up to date, which was true. So I never checked my savings account. \\n\\nThe first wire transfer was XX/XX/XXXX, for {$19000.00}. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX called me again and said his company had made another mistake and had accidentally paid into my checking account two deposits of {$20000.00} each, which amounts should have been paid to another of their creditors. He again showed me the page in my checking account on the computer and sure enough, two deposits of {$20000.00} had been made in my checking account. He asked me to again wire transfer to JP Morgan Chase the sum of {$39000.00}, which was done on XX/XX/XXXX. I still have the wire transfer documents, if that will be of any assistance. \\n\\nAll this time, they were using XXXX to access my savings account which contained over {$64000.00} ; they were transferring MY money in {$20000.00} increments into my checking account, making it look like THEIR money was being deposited into my checking account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I looked at my bank accounts and discovered that {$60000.00} was missing from my savings account and those were the three deposits of {$20000.00} that had been transferred from my savings into my checking account. I texted XXXX and he said he would check into it and get back with me. I never heard from him again, naturally. \\n\\nI went to my bank ( credit union ) and told the lady what had happened - she was the person who did the wire transfers for me. She tried to retrieve the money that was transferred but was unable to do so. She closed my accounts and gave me what was left in a cashier \\'s check. \\n\\nI called JP Morgan Chase who called me a couple of days later and said since I had voluntarily wired the money, and the account was closed, there was nothing they could do. \\n\\nIt seems to me that if someone has an account at a bank, and that account is used for theft, that the account holder should be held responsible. If the account holder can\\'t be held responsible, it seems that the bank should be held responsible for allowing money to be stolen from innocent people. \\n\\nOf course, all of this is done over the phone so there\\'s no way to verify the truth of what I\\'m saying - all I have is my word. None of the texts are incriminating. \\n\\nI\\'ve tried to contact an attorney about this, since my research indicates a Regulation E which may cover my losses to some extent, but have had no luck contacting an attorney yet. I\\'m still working on this. \\n\\nI was also contacted the same day I discovered the transfers from my savings account by someone named XXXX XXXX, who claimed he was with the FTC and would be able to get my money back for me. He gave me a complaint number, which was nothing like the complaint number I got  when I filed a report with the FTC. His number is XXXX. I called the FTC and left a message to try and confirm if this person actually worked for the FTC, but I never received a call back. \\n\\nI filed a police report, also, and the police told me not to speak with anyone else about this matter if I couldn\\'t verify who they were. I\\'ve also talked to the FBI. So far, no success. I\\'m still praying that I will get my retirement money back so I don\\'t have to go back to work. I\\'m XXXX years old, and this is my living money - I need it back! If I have to file suit, I will do so.',\n",

The document that Mr. XXXX presented was on XXXX letterhead, created by Mr. XXXX himself. The Chase Bank employee looked up XXXX on the Illinois Secretary of State website and noted to Mr. XXXX that he was NOT ( 1 ) a Manager listed on the state \\'s website, nor ( 2 ) a signatory on the account. Mr. XXXX persuaded the Chase Bank employee that the Illinois Secretary of State website was incorrect and that the documents that Mr. XXXX had provided should show that he should be added as a signatory. \\n\\nTwo days later, on XX/XX/2019, the XXXX XXXX Chase Bank added Mr. XXXX as a signatory. In those two days, Chase Bank never contacted the sole signatory on the account to verify whether Mr. XXXX should be added as a signatory. In those two days, Chase Bank never contacted the Manager listed on the Illinois Secretary of State website to verify if Mr. XXXX should be added as a signatory. In those two days, Chase Bank never contacted the Chase Bank branch office where the business account was opened and maintained to verify whether Mr. XXXX should be added as a signatory. Instead, Chase Bank added Mr. XXXX as a signatory, and then proceeded to request {$10000.00} in cash and the remaining funds in the account ( approximately {$22000.00} ) to be provided to him in a cashiers check. Chase Bank complied, and provided {$10000.00} cash to Mr. XXXX and provided the remaining amount in a cashier \\'s check. \\n\\nXXXX learned of the fraud on Thursday, XX/XX/2019 and immediately contacted Chase Bank to report it. Chase Bank stated that someone would be in touch, providing the name \" XXXX \\'\\', but that as an initial matter \" Mr. XXXX provided Chase Bank with all the necessary documentation to become a signatory on the account. \\'\\' No one at Chase Bank responded all day on Friday. At COB Friday, XXXX contacted Chase Bank and spoke with \" XXXX \\'\\' who said that the matter was escalated to XXXX, and he would likely call on Monday. \\n\\nWhen XXXX did not call the morning of XX/XX/2019, XXXX called him directly and left several messages. When XXXX finally connected with XXXX later that afternoon, XXXX informed XXXX that it had not performed any investigation, but would be in touch. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, XXXX called XXXX to state that the investigation was still ongoing, but that XXXX \\'s accounts were now frozen. XXXX reminded Chase Bank that XXXX was the victim as BUT FOR the Chase Bank employee \\'s failure to abide by internal banking policies and procedures, XXXX would still have its business funds and would not be impeded from performing its business. Although Mr. XXXX MAY HAVE provided necessary documentation, NONE of Mr. XXXX \\'s documentation or stories were verified by anyone at XXXX or a signatory on the account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, Chase Bank responded to XXXX that \" Mr. XXXX provided all the necessary documentation to become a signatory on the account \\'\\' even though he was never a signatory on the account and never a manager or controller of the company at any time. XXXX XXXX was a stranger to the XXXX business account, yet Chase Bank added him as a signatory and assisted him with fraudulently withdrawing all {$32000.00} in its business account. \\n\\nXXXX is stunned that Chase Bank would take this position when it is absolutely implicated in this fraud, has insurance to cover it\\'s role in perpetrating this fraud, denies any liability in the act, and has significantly impeded XXXX \\'s ability to do business by not reinstating those funds. \\n\\nToday, XXXX filed a complaint with the local law enforcement and the FBI.

Instead the monthly interest is being added to the principal amount so that the principal increases monthly thereby increasing the accrued interest. Consequently, Chase is charging interest on interest every month by increasing the principal when monthly payments more than cover the interest and minimum payment due. \\nXXXX informed me that although this is unfair to me, Chase does this per federal law without stating which federal law or offering to provide a copy of the federal law. He further refused to elevate this matter to his supervisor or provide an address for me to submit a written complaint. \\nThis is wrong. When monthly payments more than cover the minimum payment and interest payments, Chase can not be increasing the principal amount by adding monthly interest amounts to the principal balance to impose higher interest obligations on the consumer. \\nSince XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, the interest on the promotion interest balance has increased due to Chases practice of increasing the principal balance by adding the monthly interest to the principal and NOT applying the monthly payment to the monthly interest charged. \\nI do not believe Congress intended for Chase to legally charge interest on top of interest by allowing Chase to increase a principal balance by not applying consumers payments to the interest charged every month',\n",

Chase refuses to refund the claim of {$1000.00} and accused my husband of processing this XXXX  payment because of a common IP address. Their logic does not make sense and they refuse to provide proper documentation to support the claim denial. We have spent hours and days on the phone with Chase customer service and meetings with local branches in the attempt to find resolution. The local Chase branch directed us to file a police report and re-open the claim. We filed a police report and then Chase denied the request to re-open the claim. Chase still refuses to provide documentation to prove how the claim was denied, will not process a refund due to fraud and will not deactivate XXXX  to minimize risk of this situation in the future. This was obviously a hacker and fraud but Chase will not stand behind fraud protection and has provided the worst possible customer service through this experience.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Chase Card Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX City/ State/ Zip : XXXX, DE XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX Re : Acct # XXXX To Whom It May Concern : I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX Vs. XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). \\n\\nXXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at 13.  Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and American General attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. \\n\\nThe contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. \\n\\nI notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ XXXX. \\n\\nYou should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. \\n\\nI intend to follow through with the suit if I do not hear back from you within 15 days. \\n\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you, Thank you.\",\n",

I believe they are and some of them have been corrected on some of the bureaus and some have not. I would like to make this complaint to show the level of urgency I have towards this matter.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Hello, I was called by a chase bank representative on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX. This representative had given me a call to notify me of some fraudulent charges that were trying to be made, with that, they wanted to verify my account information so that they can close the account and issue a new debit card. So with that information being given from the representative, I assumed this would be safe also with the number not showing up as scam. So we proceed and I give the person my information needed to access the account, they said a verification text will be coming to me and to repeat the verification code, sure enough I got the code and gave to them, things still sound good. Then after about 30min being on the phone, they gave me two confirmation numbers to use to reference this call and that my account is closed and card will no longer be active and will be sent another card within 10 business days. All fine and dandy, til I never heard back from chase after the 10 days, I actually called within 5 days to  check in. Sure enough the chase representative says there was no call regarding this activity and that my account was still active and card was still active. Right away I knew this was a fraudulent/scam call and they got into my account and transferred {$1200.00} using quickpay to XXXX. I never signed up for quickpay nor did any transactions ever with XXXX. So Chase 's claim department denied the claim and I'm at loss of {$1200.00} to someone I have no idea who it is. Chase 's claim department says since my account was compromised and that I gave them my info, they can't do anything about it. This is total bs, I surely wish I knew, but when the scammer calls acting like a chase representative, knowing exactly what questions to ask and verifying them, why wouldn't I give them my info. If this is the case with all calls, then everyone would be a victim. In which I researched and sure enough this has been an ongoing fraud or scam going around, and chase chooses not to do anything about it. So i'm looking for help, my account is in the negative now because of this, many insufficient charge fees, etc. I've changed all pw, used virus scans, etc. and finally got back access to my online account and need this fraudulent transfer resolved. I'm now suffering because of this.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"JP Morgan Chase erroneously charged me for end of lease. Even more I traded my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in on a pull ahead program with XXXX XXXX at the dealer. No one at the dealer advised me of damage or the opportunity to have a pre inspection. Therefore I disputed this transaction immediately after receiving a XXXX statement. I heard nothing from them until XX/XX/XXXX which was a reduced bill for lease liability. I then sent another lease dispute letter for I wanted pictures and when I made a lease deal for my new XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX, the dealer stated this was a total deal and I took advantage of the manufacturer 's Pull Ahead Program. \\n\\nThe monthly payments were to be absorbed and the excess wear and tear was not documented. Once again, I asked for pictures and did not receive them and on top of that I was told by XXXX XXXX that this was a clean all inclusive transaction. This is very shady. \\n\\nHowever, the most damaging thing is that it has been reported to my credit as I attempted to pre-qualify for a home. This is insane! \\n\\nI was on the phone with Chase and spoke to two reps and the credit counselor there and they said there is nothing I can do. They can not remove the credit ding even if I paid in full although I know I don't owe the money. \\n\\nI asked for a letter to show to the Mortgage company from Chase to show that this is in dispute and it has been reduced and still they won't help me. They said that I had to pay it in full to stay off my credit! What a hoax and an awful way to treat a current customer. \\n\\nPlease aid me in this and I know Chase has had complaints. They provide no remedy or supervisor to speak to. Meanwhile I can not get a loan. \\n\\nThank You! \\n\\n\\nXXXX XXXX\",\n",

suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact  or a promise made without any intention of performing it\\n\\n enacted back and forth bantering  emails dispersed from myself to ms xxxx xxxx and my wife to ms xxxx xxxx   chapter added by stats ch as used in this part in

borrower\\n\\nthe sole and exclusive disclaimer made by the agents of chase which appears to countervails us c a   a  is the following statement  ms xxxx as an agent for jp morgan chase lied when she stated to me and my wife that  jp morgan chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering loan terms and interest rate to me and my wife \\n\\nshe lied when she presented to me and my wife that jp morgan chase selection of the lowest fico score was due to chases guideline  s  policy \\n\\nwhen we asked for a copy of chases guidelines she and her manager mr xxxx lied when they stated that jp morgan chase guidelines are internal documents and are not given out \\n\\nwhen ms xxxx tried to cover ms xxxx lie xxxx xxxx instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because chase does meet their competitors pricing and interest rate however when we submitted a written quote from a competitor mr xxxx in support of ms xxxx stated in an email communication that chase does not meet competitors pricing and since we had not provided a good faith fee and did not submit all documentation  we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the xxxx fico score and pricing or cancel the process \\n\\nms xxxx email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors pricinginterest rate using a xxxx fico score as ms xxxx instructed us to do with the words where did you get this from never addressing that fact that the interest rate quoted was and we did what she asked of us\\n\\nms xxxx was asked not to load any of the cost into the loan she did it anyway and when asked several times to update the loan amount she did not complete that task until friday xxxx xxxx evening when she was on her way out the door for the week \\n\\nms xxxx lied when she sent me the initial myhomechase email to login andor create login credentials in order to begin the process ms xxxx failed to provide me with the loan application number when my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the hours account creation expired ms xxxx stated that she did not provide the loan application number because she wanted me to give her a call when i discovered that i could not move forward \\n\\nit was during my wife phone conference with executive director mr xxxx xxxx on friday xxxxxxxx at xxxx that he confirmed the lies that ms xxxx represented on behalf of chase it was disclosed that chase does uses the middle fico score not the lowest it was also disclosed that chase did not have any such guideline  s  policy of using the lowest fico score as previously represented to us by ms xxxx xxxx it was disclosed that ms xxxx did not years of experience as a home loan advisor with chase mr xxxx further confirmed that ms xxxx has worked for chase for several years as a teller along with assisting other loan advisors i believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that ms xxxx has worked on alone \\n\\nmr xxxx in good faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to chases xxxx location but my wife decided to give ms xxxx the benefitofthe doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process \\ni believe mr xxxx xxxx stated to my wife that he had a conversation with ms xxxx regarding the issues \\n\\nhowever it was a big mistake to leave ms xxxx in place it also appears that the conversation that mr xxxx had with ms xxxx did not work \\nthroughout friday xxxxxxxx late afternoon ms xxxx sent me several misleading emails informing me that my loan documents were ready for me to login to myhomechase to complete the loan application process and to paid the good faith fee \\n\\ni emailed her to alert her that the documents had not been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents she then sent me another email late friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents i waited for i believe hours and i emailed her back to share with her that i had not received the separate email later in the afternoonearly evening my wife placed a call to her her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a nice weekend \\n\\nshortly after that the separate email arrived i login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the old documents i email ms xxxx back with both mr xxxx  mr xxxx on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting ms xxxx with hanging the revised documents neither mr xxxx nor mr xxxx responded \\n\\nhowever ms xxxx did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on monday and that the only thing she did was to change the loan amount \\nshe went on to let me know that mr xxxx nor mr xxxx could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a nice weekend \\n\\nin conclusion as far as i am concerned all of the above behavior is a clear representation of unfair business practices and fraudulent business practices which my last email on friday xxxx xxxx that mr xxxx responded back to and forward to his executive office clearly reflects my disdained for being subjected to  ms xxxx and mr xxxx fraudulent and unlawful conduct</td>\n",

       "200  i owe around to chase and am in a debt resolution program with xxxx xxxx xxxx i provided chase the number to xxxx xxxx xxxx and was told not to have any further contact with chase representatives as xxxx representatives would handle it as of friday xxxxxxxx i  have been receiving calls from xxxx xxxx formerly known as xxxx xxxx xxxx they are a credit collections company used by chase on friday i received calls on both xxxx and xxxx i received one call and today on xxxx i have received three calls one of these calls was a call to my office asking to speak to me however i was in a meeting the man who called was very aggressive to my boss who answered i checked with a lawyer and learned that repeated calls on the same day and calling my work are illegal practices calling my place of work puts my job at risk as stated before i have provided the number for xxxx xxxx xxxx whom they are supposed to be working with

       "203  jp morgan and chase reported loans   xxxx  xxxx and  xxxx respectively  as  cancelled debt to the irs on my behalf in xxxxxxxx they sent s to a nonexistent address one that has never been used or reported by me or my cosigner the address they used is a splicing of separate addresses in different cities in the same state this cancellation was done after chase claims they made multiple attempts to contact my cosigner for repayment an arguable fact as my cosigner has absolutely no knowledge or paperwork to that affect though chase has her correct address and phone number  i have confirmed this through phone calls with chase \\n\\nmy cosigner is a retired account and as such she keeps every scrap of paper concerning loans and financing she receives and she has no record of the loans chase reported cancellednor do i so i contacted chase to request copies of the original loan contracts as proof that the loans are in fact mine these loans do not show up on either of our credit reports so we are questioning where they came from \\n\\nmy first phone call to chase was on xxxxxxxx i spoke to a woman named xxxx in the irs notice department she was  unable to provide further information  because chase no longer directly deals with student loans i could not get a direct number into chase so i contacted our local chase bank branch and spoke to xxxx on xxxxxxxx she took my information and sent an internal email in an attempt to either get the information i was seeking or to put me in touch with the people who could \\n\\nwhen i hadnt heard anything i reached back out to xxxx on xxxxxxxx she was helping someone else so my call was taken by the branch manager who took all of my information and filed a grievance on my behalf through chase s complaint and compliance department \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i was contacted by xxxx  id  xxxx  with the complaint and compliance department she said my information had been given to the research team who would look into the loans when they completed their search she would be back in touch with what they found \\n\\non xxxxxxxx xxxx called me back and said they had located specifics on the loans in question and directed me to the chase recovery and loan specialist department who would then be able to provide the appropriate documentation i was seeking \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted the loan specialist department and spoke to a woman who confirmed the loan numbers amounts and cosigner i asked why these loans were not showing up on any credit report and she stated that the loans  drop off as soon as they are cancelled  a statement that is absolutely false i requested copies of the original loan contracts and she said she would have them sent to me with no issue the contract was post marked xxxxxxxx and arrived xxxxxxxx however the contract she sent was not the correct loan contract it was not the correct dates amount or loan number\\n\\nrealizing that i wasnt getting anywhere my cosigner contacted chase on xxxxxxxx attempting to get the information i requested the man she spoke to again confirmed details but instead of sending contracts referred her to the irs for further questions \\n\\non xxxxxxxx my cosigner again contacted chase to directly request contract copies for these loans on this phone call she was told she was not a cosigner and therefore could not be given any information or sent any contracts \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted chase again and spoke to loan specialist   xxxx who confirmed that my cosigner was in fact on the loans she said the original loans were taken out between xxxx she said loans were charged off xxxxxxxx letters sent in xxxx and reported cancelled in xxxx this time she could not confirm the address the s were sent to she said she had no idea where the address came from  she also corrected previous information given and confirmed that these loans should be on our credit reports  she offered to send me to the credit reporting dept to  fix  the non reported loans  i declined  she said she had requested copies of the original contracts as well as copies of the s for these loans to be sent to me in business days unfortunately the only documentation she sent were s with the wrong address i have still yet to receive a single piece of paper relating to these loan contracts\\n\\nit has been months numerous phones calls and misinformation and i can not get any tangible proof that the loans reported cancelled on my name and social are in fact my loans and my responsibility i once again called chase on xxxxxxxx and asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge who could give me a definitive answer and send me concrete proof of these loans i was transferred to a voicemail left a very specific message with appropriate contact information and i have yet to receive a phone call back as of xxxxxxxx even though the voicemail greeting specifically states that a callback will take place within business hours

       "228  to supervisor i wish to make a complaint regarding the case managment of xxxx xxxx i would like to bring to the attention that mr xxxx failed to properly communicate with me and my representative i received the following calls from mr xxxx    xxxx at xxxx xxxx he left voice mail \\nxxxx at xxxx xxxx we spoke briefly and i asked him to call back at noon \\nxxxx xxxx at xxxx xxxx he left voice mail \\nxxxx at xxxx xxxx i left voice message for a return call his voice message indicated a return call within hours \\nxxxx at xxxx xxxx i left another voice messsage for return call \\n\\ndue to not returning my calls and the importance of my issues i reached out to my representive from xxxx who began making calls to mr xxxx on my behalf i am sure she made notes on the date and time she left several messages there was even a little joke on when mr xxxx was going to return her call she said  watch he is going to call her when he is about to walk out the door  later that day i forgot what day it was be mr xxxx sure enough called at xxxx according to his outgoing voice message he gets off at xxxx having dealt with sneaky tactics by chase for years i could only shack my head \\n\\nat the time i needed to speak directly with him having worked in an environment where i need to stay on top of clients and files i know that a supervisor needs to be notified when there is a failure to meet expectations i expected a phone call to verbally answer questions i did not get that nor did my representative

       "265  i am submitting a complaint regarding the actions that chase performed on xxxxxxxx by selling the home i previously owned via foreclosure despite an active sales contract that was approved and agreed upon through xxxx tn bankruptcy court \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i entered into agreement with xxxx xxxx real estate agent for xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx tn to begin the process of a short sale of my home the initial proposed sales contract dated xxxxxxxx was submitted to chase for review and consideration on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase stating the amount submitted was too low to consider and to submit a new or updates sales contract \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase indicating that my home was scheduled for foreclosure on xxxxxxxx two days later xxxxxxxx a new contract was submitted with a new buyer and a new amount of xxxx chase approved the short sale with the proposed amount the sales agreement listed the closing date as xxxxxxxx this sale was approved by the tn xxxx   district bankruptcy court on xxxxxxxx the agreed short sale was stopped because  seller unable to provide good title  because the home was in bankruptcy a lien was placed on it to assure that any proceeds of the sale would be paid to jp morgan chase as part of the bankruptcy agreement the approval authorizing the sale specifically stated conditions that jp morgan chase bank and all liens would be paid in full as the closing \\n\\non xxxxxxxx chase sold the home as a foreclosure auction by a third party at the same approved amount of xxxx chase was fully aware that a short sale which had been approved by the bankruptcy court was to have been completed by xxxxxxxx once the sale had been completed all liens would have been released and the seller could have received a complete title free from any liens \\n\\nbecause chase did not fulfill the approval of the sale via bankruptcy and sold the home as a foreclosure i will now have a foreclosure listed on my credit and that should not be the case chase negligence in adhering to the approval of the sale has now placed my credit in a dismal state \\n\\nbecause chase neglected to fulfill the approved sale of the home that was agreed upon and in process of closing on xxxxxxxx a foreclosure was performed once the short sale had been completed the new homeowner would have received a title that was free from all liens

       "293  i ask chase auto finance please honor the written agreement and refund an amount of xxxx based on the excess mileage amount in section of our lease change their policies so that they specifically communicate the effective due date in writing so customers don’t feel threatened to pay any amount they claim as soon as possible before the account gets closed and sent to collections without prior noticeplease find the details of my claim belowonxxxxxxxx i returned a leased car for which i had a car loan with chase auto finance onxxxxxxxx i received a letter from the end of lease department at chase auto finance with my total lease liability including excess mileagethe excess mileage amount due was xxxx which assumed a charge of xxxx cents per excess mile however this does not match what was stipulated in my lease agreement with xxxx xxxx xxxx which stated in section that “you may be charged for excessive wear based on our standards for normal use and for mileage in excess of a xxxxxxxx miles per year at a rate of b xxxx  cents per mile” please find a copy of my lease agreement attachedthis came as a surprise to me because a few months before the end of my lease i spoke with xxxx xxxx from jxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the sales person i attended me in xxxxxxxx when i took lease of the car i explained to him that my lease stated an excess of xxxx  cents per mile instead of xxxx cents per mile and he said that someone probably made a mistakethe excess mileage amount stated in the lease agreement is xxxx  cents not xxxx cents therefore the amount owed for excess mileage should be xxxx i ask chase auto finance to please honor the written agreement and refund the difference of xxxxi have tried to remediate this issue with chase before reaching this point i called the end of lease department at xxxx xxxx several times and i spoke with different people the first time onxxxxxxxx i was asked to fax my lease agreement so they could compare it against what they had on their records i called again on xxxxxxxx and twice on xxxxxxxx in all instances i was told that the agreement stated xxxx cents per mile and that the amount owed would not be amended on xxxxxxxx i tried to escalate my complaint to a supervisor i spoke with someone with idxxxxxxxxxxxx who told me i would get a call back from another supervisor in hours i asked for a contact number in case i did not hear back and i got a phone number xxxx xxxx and a name xxxx but they refused to give me a last name i never received a call back or a voicemailduring one of these calls i also asked what the due date to pay the amount owed was because the letter i originally received from chase just said “please pay this amount upon receipt of this letter” i was told that they would close the account after between and days after being open and send it to collections i asked to get that in writing but they refused several timesi got in touch with xxxx xxxx chase private client and xxxx xxxxxxxx chase branch manager from the xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx ca office who helped escalate the issue with chase auto finance they first asked me to call xxxx xxxx extension xxxx and ask for xxxx who i talked to and got the same response as before then they opened a ticket with the chase branch complaint escalation team and i got in touch with xxxx xxxx xxxx   extension xxxx who reached out to chase auto finance they reviewed my case and they stood by their decision of charging me xxxx cents per milei then asked xxxx if she could ask chase auto finance to get clarity on the due date she called them and was told that they could close the account and send it to collections as soon as days after being opened and again refused to provide written proofgiven the circumstances i felt threatened to pay the total amount due to protect my credit score

stated to me and my wife that  jp morgan chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering loan terms and interest rate to me and my wife \\n\\nshe lied when she presented to me and my wife that jp morgan chase selection of the lowest fico score was due to chases guideline  s  policy \\n\\nwhen we asked for a copy of chases guidelines she and her manager mr xxxx lied when they stated that jp morgan chase guidelines are internal documents and are not given out \\n\\nwhen ms xxxx tried to cover ms xxxx lie xxxx xxxx instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because chase does meet their competitors pricing and interest rate however when we submitted a written quote from a competitor mr xxxx in support of ms xxxx stated in an email communication that chase does not meet competitors pricing and since we had not provided a good faith fee and did not submit all documentation  we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the xxxx fico score and pricing or cancel the process \\n\\nms xxxx email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors pricinginterest rate using a xxxx fico score as ms xxxx instructed us to do with the words where did you get this from never addressing that fact that the interest rate quoted was and we did what she asked of us\\n\\nms xxxx was asked not to load any of the cost into the loan she did it anyway and when asked several times to update the loan amount she did not complete that task until friday xxxx xxxx evening when she was on her way out the door for the week \\n\\nms xxxx lied when she sent me the initial myhomechase email to login andor create login credentials in order to begin the process ms xxxx failed to provide me with the loan application number when my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the hours account creation expired ms xxxx stated that she did not provide the loan application number because she wanted me to give her a call when i discovered that i could not move forward \\n\\nit was during my wife phone conference with executive director mr xxxx xxxx on friday xxxxxxxx at xxxx that he confirmed the lies that ms xxxx represented on behalf of chase it was disclosed that chase does uses the middle fico score not the lowest it was also disclosed that chase did not have any such guideline  s  policy of using the lowest fico score as previously represented to us by ms xxxx xxxx it was disclosed that ms xxxx did not years of experience as a home loan advisor with chase mr xxxx further confirmed that ms xxxx has worked for chase for several years as a teller along with assisting other loan advisors i believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that ms xxxx has worked on alone \\n\\nmr xxxx in good faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to chases xxxx location but my wife decided to give ms xxxx the benefitofthe doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process \\ni believe mr xxxx xxxx stated to my wife that he had a conversation with ms xxxx regarding the issues \\n\\nhowever it was a big mistake to leave ms xxxx in place it also appears that the conversation that mr xxxx had with ms xxxx did not work \\nthroughout friday xxxxxxxx late afternoon ms xxxx sent me several misleading emails informing me that my loan documents were ready for me to login to myhomechase to complete the loan application process and to paid the good faith fee \\n\\ni emailed her to alert her that the documents had not been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents she then sent me another email late friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents i waited for i believe hours and i emailed her back to share with her that i had not received the separate email later in the afternoonearly evening my wife placed a call to her her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a nice weekend \\n\\nshortly after that the separate email arrived i login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the old documents i email ms xxxx back with both mr xxxx  mr xxxx on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting ms xxxx with hanging the revised documents neither mr xxxx nor mr xxxx responded \\n\\nhowever ms xxxx did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on monday and that the only thing she did was to change the loan amount \\nshe went on to let me know that mr xxxx nor mr xxxx could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a nice weekend \\n\\nin conclusion as far as i am concerned all of the above behavior is a clear representation of unfair business practices and fraudulent business practices which my last email on friday xxxx xxxx that mr xxxx responded back to and forward to his executive office clearly reflects my disdained for being subjected to  ms xxxx and mr xxxx fraudulent and unlawful conduct   \n",

       "373  i found that in xxxxxxxx chase my mortgage company had not been reporting my mortgage payments after alerting chase on xxxxxxxx chase sent me a letter that stated they agree with me and they would begin reporting to the major credit reporting agencies listing them specifically including xxxx \\non xxxxxxxx i wrote to chase alerting them that my xxxx credit report in fact did not list them at all xxxx xxxx executive director with chase wrote back xxxxxxxx and essentially blamed xxxx stating  theres an internal credit agency policy thats preventing your account from showing up on your credit file  chase advised that i contact xxxx \\non xxxxxxxx i spoke indepth to several departments at xxxx and they do not have chase as a creditor that is reporting my mortgage payments \\ndespite me telling chase that i spoke with xxxx giving chase a copy of my credit report showing that they are not listed and telling chase that xxxx  suggested they call them chase has not called them or attempted to correct my report instead chase is deliberately not reporting and deliberately lying to me by continuing to claim that they are chase simply keeps telling me they are reporting although xxxx and my credit report proves differently \\n\\nchase has lied to me for years by claiming they have been reporting there are years of mortgage payments that are missing from xxxx

       "402  i applied for a chase credit card affiliated with united airlines i was sent an email at application that stated further review was needed after days i contacted chase to inquire about the status the automated response said it was still in review i then opted to talk to a representative the call was answered and i asked status and was told it was denied i asked why and they wouldnt give me a reason i stated i believed that there must be some type of mistake that they either had my income wrong or debt wrong because i know my credit score is in the upper s i only have one other credit card with a larger limit but paid in full monthly and a house payment i know my debt to income ratio is and i have been in the same line of work for over years i happen to be a xxxx  xxxx and know there is no business reason that i would be denied so there had to be an error somewhere in the application process i said i assumed they were double counting my mortgage as i had recently refinanced and they could easily be double counting the lady wouldnt respond in any way i asked to speak to a loan officer or supervisor to try and resolve any possible issue and was asked if i didnt mind being called back and i replied that was fine she said i would receive a call within the next minutes and verified my phone number i have never received a call back ive been a customer of chase in the past and all my accounts and all were handled as agreed ive never missed or been late on a payment in my life i understand if there was an error on my application but the fact they wouldnt wont and havent allowed me to address the issue even after repeated attempts is a major problem it is either a problem or they are discriminating

       "413  in regards to xxxx  chase card services  can someone tell me whats the point of having this company as travel insurance from my understanding the point of travel insurance is to protect a travel purchaseinvestment from an unforeseen issue well if thats the case please ditch this company and find someone more reliable who will step in and actually pay you back your lost investment when things get messy or out of hand between other vendors and third partiesthis is an absolute scam a disservice to the customers theyre supposedly serving and puts the insurance industry in a more negative light than it already is in \\n\\ni advised on xxxx  xxxx xxxx xxxx about a trip cancellation request in regards to a medical issue and proceeded as expected  i uploaded medical documents made notations of my fare and provided all necessary correspondence between the travel agent  flightsmojo  and the common carrier  sq  xxxx then suggested i reach out to both the airline and travel agent and request what documentation is needed both parties said differing statements and both can hardly speak a lick of english and why am i reaching out im literally doing your work for you this is your job not mine \\n\\nthe problem only got much worse when xxxx repeatedly asked for an updated medical document from my physician s office to which i complied and then they asked for an updated medical document with a fancy signature and a stamp  and another one with nicer handwriting to the point where they were just beating around the bush to hope the situation drops its clear to see they  dont want to comply with the situation because they would be losing money on the ticket sale hence the repeated use of asking for new medical documentation \\n\\nxxxx s clause of  did you attempt to reach out for refunds or credits  is an absolute joke because clearly i did and have provided the documents ad nauseum but the third party here is avoiding the situation to not lose their profit this travel insurer shouldve stepped in and solved the issue directly by providing a refund for the airfare based on the travel agent s reluctance to cooperate given the excessive requests when the claims examiner makes useless statements like   after all sir we are just a secondary travel insurance provider and theres nothing we can really do  is an insult equivalent to rubbing salt in the wound way to be more of the problem than the solution \\n\\n\\nif you have xxxx with your visa xxxx or other travel based credit card please stay away from using this insurer i was super optimistic about this perk with my chase sapphire reserve but  now have found it to be absolutely worthless ive heard the insurance on xxxx xxxx is better but ill have to see for myself this company is without a doubt useless and scammy and is in dire need a class action lawsuit against them

       "434  on i went into a chase branch to close a checking account and change the source account of my chase auto loan automatic payments to a nonchase account since i am attempting to close the chase checking account currently linked to my auto loan payments i was informed that i am unable to make this change in person and that i must fax in a form that can allegedly be found online additionally i was told i should wait to change this information until after my next scheduled payment had been processed \\n\\non i called chase customer service for assistance since attempts to access the online form resulted in errors during this call i was passed to different representatives each time being instructed to go to their website to download the same form that resulted in error messages finally the last person i spoke with was able to explain that my loan was associated with something called xxxx they informed me that as chase is no longer associated with xxxx and that due to this i am unable to simply update the account that i would like to pay my auto loan through and would need to apply for a new loan with chase in order to pay from a different account i was finally told that i would be sent the form to change the account for the automatic payments and i should receive the form in about business days \\n\\non i received a letter in the mail from chase stating  we have enclosed an automatic change agreement for you to complete  unfortunately there was no form enclosed i called their customer service again on at xxxx xxxx cst to speak to someone about this issue once again i was informed that there is nothing they can do to update my source of payment after being on the phone for minutes with this representative i was transferred to a manager who told me they would actually send the form this time \\n\\nplease note that nearly a month later as of i have yet to be able to cancel my checking account with chase furthermore as of i will be assessed a service fee for an account i have been trying to close for over a month \\n\\nforcing me to apply for a new loan and negatively impact my credit just to be able to pay my current loan from a different nonchase account feels extremely unfair and i feel as though chase is intentionally delaying my ability to change the source of my payments in order to get more fees from me

       "446  on i filed a complaint with cfpb against chase mortgage lender because they outright sold my note without providing me days of notice prior to this transaction \\n\\nthe only way i found out the true date of sale is from the buyer who accidentally included the true date of sale in a letter to me \\n\\nchase got upset that i filed this complaint and tried to call me when they are prohibited from direct calls to me as i am in a federally protected chapter xxxx chase is only allowed to notify my lawyer of any transaction that takes place they also need to notify the chapter xxxx trustee which they did not do \\n\\non after their illegal call to me they sent me a non certified letter explaining they received my complaint while simultaneously failing to communicate any of this matter to my law firm or the xxxx county court trustee \\n\\ntwo days after their letter ironically the new lender sent me a foreclosure notice claiming ive been late on my new payment when i have never missed a payment all of my payments are processed through the chapter xxxx trustee court filing system in xxxx county this is deceptive and total harassment during the holiday season it appears that chase waited to perform these sneaky actions \\n\\nas a result we are hiring a firm to perform a total xxxx report on the chase mortgage to discover whether or not they have sold bonds separating the bond from the note on this loan i have every intention of filing a respa suit and more against them for these actions

to point out that i went into a chase branch and showed them chase documents that the scammer sent to me regarding the wire transfer and was told by the banker that the documents were indeed legitimate after trusting the banker i felt comfortable sending the funds believing this was a trustworthy transaction i tried contacting chase to see if they could reverse or refund the charges however they only pointed to the terms and conditions of xxxx and said it was nonrefundable they did not try to help at all in retrieving the money or finding a way to dispute the scam i was told that it only should be used with small amounts and to family friends etc xxxx nor chase bank makes this information easily accessible and in the end the only person that loses out is the customervictim

soon as i knew i wasnt going to be working they said over and over it was okay we could work it out when i got back to work then a month in they started putting me as delinquent i tried to pay but you cant get something from nothing all of my money was going to heat and electric and food i even wiped my retirement account just to keep the house afloat i contacted chase again and asked them to just hold on for two months until i was back at work they said okay thats fine to take care of your health then the next month they closed my accounts im drowning in it i cant believe after years of an excellent business relationship this multimillion dollar company couldnt give me a threemonth stay im back to work now one month behind on my mortgage and hundreds of dollars in fees later from chase

       "531  in response to a complaint i filed xxxx xxxx from the chase executive office attempted to reach me by calling my wife s phone number on separate occasions my wife was not able to take the call because she was at work i returned each call and left messages asking ms xxxx to call me at my phone number  she had initially called me at the correct number several times  on the third call i made to ms xxxx i told her if she did not call me at the correct number i would file another complaint regarding this matter she has not called back but someone named xxxx from chase is now calling the incorrect number i have left a message for him with the correct number and am filing this complaint hoping it will compel chase to address this matter in good faith

service phone number listed on the back of my card  payments are due on the xxxx of the month  to learn that i was days past due and explained that auto payment had been requested on my end via the online tool which they explained could take business cycles but did not appear to have gone into affect \\n\\nadditionally i learned that they did not have the correct contact information in the system but instead had reached out to old email addresses and telephone contact information from previous accounts that had auto populated instead of using the correct information i had provided at the time of application \\n\\ni made a payment by phone immediately to payoff the entire balance requested auto payment to be setup and confirmed on their end as well as requested that the current contact information be setup in the system to avoid missing communications in the future \\n\\nthey made notation in the account of the challenge reversed all late charges and ensured me that the late

payment in full and notation that i would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which i have received this reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end \\n\\nall subsequent payments have been made on time and as of xxxxxxxx the account has a balance due to charges made after payment in full

by chase for xxxx i filed a dispute and in xxxx received an email from xxxx  stating the dispute had been resolved upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed \\n\\ni contacted chase xxxx visa explained the negative reporting the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges they stated that the  credit bureau unit  was not currently open and requested i call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information \\n\\ni followed the advice and spoke with xxxx cbu specialist in the xxxx mo call center after a long period of discussion xxxx informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau \\n\\nafter requesting all notation on my file he advised i send a fax to the

me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to xxxx customer service \\n\\nin speaking with xxxx in customer service i believed that i was still speaking to the credit bureau department i recalled all events she confirmed the notation in the account additionally i advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on xxxxxxxx my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all chase accounts i was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account i received a screen that stated that i needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbersemail that were prepopulated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information i had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once i was able to gain access into the account i confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the default contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information \\n\\ni explained to her that when i tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account she assisted with updating on her end had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information \\n\\ngiven all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup i asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting at this point she advised me that i had been transferred out of the credit bureau department and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done i explained that i had already spoken with xxxx in that department and that i was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her she stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to days to provide a call back \\n\\nshe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named xxxx explained the situation and xxxx told her that there  was nothing that

       "43   chase sent me an email today with the innocuous title  important information regarding changes to your chase account   they often use similar titles for ads and other communications  \\n\\nin it they force me into binding arbitration  despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them  \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out \\n\\nthis is blatant malpractice by chase

       "17   with out notice jp morgan chase restricted my account by my debit card tuesday on thursday i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in

       "65   i opened the chasexxxx xxxx rewards credit card at the time i was verbally told that the offer was xxxx rapid reward points and a companion pass after spending  xxxx in the first three months i followed a link provided to open the credit card now they are saying that the offer was over at the time and they have given me a much less valuable signup promotion that doesnt include the companion pass the companion pass was the entire reason we signedup and the reason the card was promoted to me they have informed me that the offer was from jan and that my cc shows approval on the xxxx xxxx the supervisor i spoke to said that they specifically dont send out offer details to confirm your offer when you sign up  thus denying me evidence  but also that they cant fix it without this evidence i feel that their offer and subsequent actions are fraudulent and constitute deceptive practices when i spoke to xxxx they acknowledged that it doesnt seem right but stated that chase is the one who has to authorize the deals so the error was definitely on their end

       "59   i currently have over xxxx chase ultimate rewards points which are worth at least around months ago  when i tried to access my chase ultimate rewards account  or even activate the bonus on chase freedom  i would get shown this page that says  we are unable to complete your request at this time   image attached as well   xxxx  xxxx at first i thought it was just a temporary error  which isnt uncommon for chase  but after weeks this was still happening so i called customer support they opened a ticket got escalated to their tech team but when i would call back to find out what happened they told me that the case had been closed this happened times and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information \\n\\ngoing from ultimaterewardscom and chasecom have the  same result \\n\\nim not able to use these points by phone either because the operators for the travel center are not able to access my accountpoints neither \\n\\nive tried every browser both xxxx and xxxx computers and the xxxx chase phone application they all send me to the page that says  we are unable to complete your request at this time  on xxxxxxxx i looked up some people that work in ultimate rewards on xxxx and cold called a vp of customer relations he acted like he was helpful at first and we exchanged some emails he eventually said i can buy a flighthotel using chase sapphire and if i give him the details he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase \\n\\nlong story short he wasnt able to fix anything \\n\\ni can see that im still collecting points but i havent been able to access it \\n\\ni travel a lot and its become a huge inconvenience that im not able to access these points which i intended to use for travel i need to get this issue resolved asap

savings account and the other user on my account i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user customer rep told me they would call me back in minutes to keep the line open i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor xxxx who said the card was activated and the transaction would process called the catering company and card was declined i then used my xxxx  xxxx card to pay for the order xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes contacted caterer and xxxx  xxxx was declined i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for hours called caterer  card declined use a mastercard  which processed went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of it was declined i was told by chase i was not over limit still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the transaction never been declined by either chase or xxxx  xxxx before  today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear  it never did

       "64   chase is marketing credit cards to those of us with good credit like its going out of style be careful  the marketing is not clear if you already have a swa chase personal card do not apply for the new one online this has sent me through a xxxx triangle wasting my time and therefore money \\n\\nit appears in the middle of chase expanded their undisclosed rule to include all cobranded cards not just swa yet the marketing machine continues to ignore this policy and the agents on the phone are not well trained i am contacting the credit bureau bc two of the cards opened are not mine  that is the silver lining here \\n\\nhowever the issue with incessant marketing of their branded cards to customers plus this confusing rule and lack of agent phone training is false advertising the information is still relatively opaque as chase never comments on the rule but multiple reader and community data points suggest denials due to for cards previously exempt \\n\\ncfpb

       "82   i recently called to ask chase bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx

       "58   i made a purchase of on xxxxxxxx i made payments of on xxxxxxxx and on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of in xxxx the promotional balance was a difference of apparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase  was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx

       "287  i have a chase sapphire reserved card and the payment is due the first of the month to pay the bill i can go through the chase credit card website and it automatically draws the payment from my bank account the payment normally takes several hours to be completed although they do state that it can take up to two business days i normally schedule the payment two days in advance of when my payment is due to ensure that it is received on time taking into account weekends and how many business days there are before the first of the month \\n\\ni have made payments for this credit card on time for every single month however on at least four instances the credit card is saying payments have been late and they charge a late fee and interest charge for the first two instances i know i made the payments on time but the company said it was posted late and so they charged fees when i found out i called the credit card company and spoke to their customer service representative and eventually after talking to supervisors they acknowledged that their system inappropriately delayed when the payment was shown as posting and so they refunded the late fees and interest charged more recently for this past xxxx it occurred again and then for xxxx i went online and made the payment but when i got my statement for xxxx recently its saying that the payment was never received and so it charged late fees and interested for both xxxx and xxxx i am tying to talk to them to get them to address these situations as well and am hoping they will resolve it but its now seeming to be a pattern and i have heard from others who have this credit card  and other credit cards  that they experience this as well i dont know if its just errors in these companies  systems or if it is purposeful as a way for them to collect late fees and interest charges from unsuspecting customers i am lucky in that i am familiar with consumer protections laws and so know how to call them and challenge them but i worry that many consumers wont notice or wont know how to challenge them and so just pay them i am wondering if others have complained about this to cfpb and so perhaps it is in fact a pattern that requires investigation thank you for your time and consideration and for all you do to help protect consumers across the country

still being debited from my account this time i got a hold of xxxx her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd she told me that while they were  investigating  these open claims money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it finally on xxxxxxxx i received a voicemail from xxxx to call her as soon as possible i returned her call once school was dismissed for the day it was at that point that xxxx told me they closed their  investigation  of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision when asked what research they used to complete their  investigation  xxxx became short and told me i would have to subpoena the information at that point i hung up because i felt that it was a lose lose situation

       "213  my mortgage is with chase my payments were being made by xxxx xxxx xxxx paying early each month xxxx was the provider of xxxx to chase evidently xxxx was sold to xxxx on xxxx transferred the files and told xxxx that chase said i was bankrupt and to terminate the processes xxxx did and did not pay chase any longer i have received no communication from anyone on this i was going to open a checking account at chase today and noticed that my mortgage had not been paid i called and they said that xxxx will not pay them and have terminated me to bankruptcy which i am not in since the mortgage holder would know after much pain i was able to get a mortgage verification letter sent to xxxx so they can restart my payments however i had to make a complete payment pay late fees and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history \\n\\nxxxx was negligent with the files transfer and xxxx was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered \\n\\nwhat can be done i have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me no one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances i thought that i am entitled to all records about myself \\n\\ni am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run xxxx must have been really evil and xxxx doesnt really read what they are given or even contact the person xxxx did not let me know they were changing services \\n\\ni can provide only the mortgage verification from chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data they say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed evidently xxxx did not use a human review process to read only accept checked fields of bad records

       "21   on xxxx i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team

from people is money just because you can is not ok\\n\\nsee attached documents when chase refund they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place

       "45   i made a purchase with xxxx xxxx xxxx on in the amount of i was charged twice for this transaction i placed a disputes case with chase bank on when i noticed the charge on my account i called back on sunday about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday i was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided i used my debt card on monday then tried to use it again but it would not work i went to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity i was shocked because i had not reported fraud on my account i later found out that i was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx  xxxx i later contacted xxxx xxxx  xxxx again and was told that they did see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within days i contacted the chase disputes department again on monday xxxxxxxx and explained thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that i did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim the escalation manager did not care and told me that chase decision on closing my account was final i had been a customer of chase for xxxx   years my character has been challenged by the disputes agents and i consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander \\n\\ni am not seeking to keep my account open with chase but i also do not want chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily \\n\\nonce again i do not want chase to have the checking account that i had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by chase \\n\\ni did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past

       "130  i purchased tickets  using my xxxx xxxx xxxx chase credit card  for my family of four and my two parents to go overseas from the us to xxxx for the first time last fall i purchased through a discount airline  xxxx  as it would not have been financially possible with another carrier our tickets were round trip not purchased as individual one way fares four tickets were purchased for my family on xxxxxxxx  and my parents tickets were purchased xxxxxxxx all six of us flew from the us xxxxxxxx my family of four were set to return xxxxxxxx with my parents set to return xxxxxxxx \\n\\nas xxxx airlines began experiencing financial difficulties they started changing and cancelling flights my return was cancelled because my flight from xxxx to xxxx wasnt being flown i was told by xxxx if i could get to xxxx on another airline i could catch a flight from xxxx back to the us with xxxx needing to get back to work as a teacher i booked flights from xxxx to xxxx at my own expense two days later xxxx failed altogether my new tickets to xxxx were now worthless as xxxx could no longer able to get me back to the us and no other carriers had flights to my destination \\n\\nbecause of this i was forced to buy new tickets from xxxx to the us on united airlines for all passengers obviously this caused some serious stress throughout our trip and also some serious financial strain that was unexpected the return flight i purchased were as much as the round trip tickets i had originally purchased on wow so my airfare essentially doubled \\n\\nupon contacting chase when i got home i was told that i would only partially be refunded because i was provided partial service the customer service representative and supervisor  both of which were friendly  equated it to buying a pair of pants and a shirt if the pants were not acceptable i still have to pay for the shirt my contention is a little different i purchased round trip tickets all part of the same trip the service i purchased was to get me to my destination and get me back to my origin all as one transaction \\n\\ni was not left in a better position by being flown across the world and left with not so much as an email from xxxx that they were closing i incurred additional flight lodging food etc my questions for the representatives were simple but with no adequate responses \\n\\nif i buy a flight with a connection if i am flown to the connecting city but not flown to my destination is this considered a service should i have to pay for part of a flight \\nif i pay someone to put on a new roof and they tear it off but dont put new shingles back on do i have to pay for partial service \\n\\nin both of these cases just like my case we were not left in a better position we were most definitely left in a much worse position if xxxx was still in business i would be asking them for a complete refund and if that did not work i would be suing them for damages according to xxxx xxxx xxxx which would have applied if they were still in business i would have been entitled to xxxx euros per flight for the original cancellation of my return as well as the cancellation of the rescheduled flight they would also be liable for lodging new flights booked food etc in total this would add up to literally  xxxx \\n\\nyet i am being told by chase that xxxx in some way provided me something for which i should be grateful enough to pay of the original in actuality it seems much more likely that chase is not willing to take on this liability since xxxx is not here anymore to refund me the money however this is why i use my credit card to make these purchases consumer protection \\n\\ni have worked through multiple levels of employees but non have been empowered to make an actual decision beyond  sorry company policy

       "129  this complaint is a follow up regarding a complaint  xxxx filed on cfpb \\n\\nthe original complaint was regarding a dispute detailed below \\n\\nmy laptop was stolen last year and someone used my information to book two flights from two different cities headed to the same destination i immediately disputed the transactions as soon as i got a notificationi filed the complaint within an hour of getting notification that flights have been booked on my credit card chase was extremely slow to respond and didnt do due diligence and contact the airline right away to cancel the flight and get me a refund \\nchase did a very poor job at investigating the incident and put the charges back on my credit card without doing a proper investigation when i asked i was told that i benefited from the transactions clearly i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination later the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop proof that the flights were booked under my name however the date of births used to book the flights were not mine clearly i couldnt have benefited from the services even if i wanted to \\nthe way chase handled the dispute was extremely poor and after multiple bad experiences and inability of chase to resolve disputes i am pretty positive that chase is horrible at resolving disputes \\ni am over that but this complaint i am filing is not about the original claimplease read below about this complaint \\n\\nplease read this carefully \\n\\nafter this incident i contacted xxxx and inquired about the flight they told me that they found too bookings for the same person headed to the same destination from two destinations and cancelled one of the bookings and issued a refund chase has not contacted xxxx once to resolve this issue xxxx has confirmed several times that they have issued me a refund and the money has been transferred to my bank account however chase hasnt issued me a refund whenever i contact chase they give me same old response the case has been closed i am not opening the same claim its a new complaint xxxx has issued me a refund and it hasnt been given to me by chase xxxx s customer service can not connect me to the accounting team and therefore it not possible for me to find the transaction and detailsthis is chase banks job connect with them and find out whats going on instead chase is asking me to contact xxxx and prove that the refund has been issued xxxx is telling me to have my bank contact their accounting department because its a banks job to resolve this issuesnow i am filing a new complaint demanding my money with interest and all the time chase has wasted \\ni am attaching the documents that xxxx has provided me chase has asked me to provide these documents its chase s job but i am doing this ob their behalf \\n\\nxxxx is clearly stating that the bank has the funds they have also provided me a document showing that transaction details that the refund was applied to my account \\n\\nplease issue me a refund i have done everything i could have please do not close my complaint without issuing me a refund that xxxx has issued a long time ago \\nenough is enough

       "88   i preordered an item on xxxxxxxx and paid with a chase credit card the merchant xxxx xxxx gave an estimated product shipment date of  xxxxxxxx  after waiting for this item for a significant amount of time i decided to cancel the order as it did not appear that the item would ever be completed and shipped on xxxxxxxx i requested a refund from the merchant xxxx xxxx on xxxxxxxx the merchant stated that my order was cancelled and the refund would return to the original method of payment in five business days the original method of payment was a chase credit card that i had since closed on xxxxxxxx i sent a secure message to chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open chase cards i also followed up with a phone call that same week and the representative i spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase indicating that my  disputed charge  would remain on my account and  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  i followed up with a phone call to chase describing that this was a refund not a dispute the representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts i explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds they informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund i am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account on xxxxxxxx i sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails i received from the merchant about the refund  see attachment   on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase with similar language about  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  and  we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research   see attachment  on xxxxxxxx i followed up with the merchant xxxx xxxx requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds on xxxxxxxx the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded  see attachment  this was my last exchange trying to resolve this between the credit card or the merchant

i could cancel it and get a refund which is what supposed to post in my account in days and on xxxxxxxx i got the money back so i purchase another airline ticket with the same money that i got back but it was xxxx dollar and the money was taking out of my available balance on xxxxxxxx but it was saying pending on the statement but it was out of my available balance already on xxxxxxxx the xxxx dollar was taking again out of my account but showing in my account as it was only one charge  and i am not even able to see the first airline ticket or the refund on my statement because they said it was dropped charge like it was never happened but it did happenedthats not the first time this happened it did happened before but i usually get the money back after the weekend on monday but this time no it did got back  i tried calling them and they explaining but they only say one thing i dont see it on the statement so why i cant see my purchase for the first airline ticket that it was

       "200  i owe around to chase and am in a debt resolution program with xxxx xxxx xxxx i provided chase the number to xxxx xxxx xxxx and was told not to have any further contact with chase representatives as xxxx representatives would handle it as of friday xxxxxxxx i  have been receiving calls from xxxx xxxx formerly known as xxxx xxxx xxxx they are a credit collections company used by chase on friday i received calls on both xxxx and xxxx i received one call and today on xxxx i have received three calls one of these calls was a call to my office asking to speak to me however i was in a meeting the man who called was very aggressive to my boss who answered i checked with a lawyer and learned that repeated calls on the same day and calling my work are illegal practices calling my place of work puts my job at risk as stated before i have provided the number for xxxx xxxx xxxx whom they are supposed to be working with

       "203  jp morgan and chase reported loans   xxxx  xxxx and  xxxx respectively  as  cancelled debt to the irs on my behalf in xxxxxxxx they sent s to a nonexistent address one that has never been used or reported by me or my cosigner the address they used is a splicing of separate addresses in different cities in the same state this cancellation was done after chase claims they made multiple attempts to contact my cosigner for repayment an arguable fact as my cosigner has absolutely no knowledge or paperwork to that affect though chase has her correct address and phone number  i have confirmed this through phone calls with chase \\n\\nmy cosigner is a retired account and as such she keeps every scrap of paper concerning loans and financing she receives and she has no record of the loans chase reported cancellednor do i so i contacted chase to request copies of the original loan contracts as proof that the loans are in fact mine these loans do not show up on either of our credit reports so we are questioning where they came from \\n\\nmy first phone call to chase was on xxxxxxxx i spoke to a woman named xxxx in the irs notice department she was  unable to provide further information  because chase no longer directly deals with student loans i could not get a direct number into chase so i contacted our local chase bank branch and spoke to xxxx on xxxxxxxx she took my information and sent an internal email in an attempt to either get the information i was seeking or to put me in touch with the people who could \\n\\nwhen i hadnt heard anything i reached back out to xxxx on xxxxxxxx she was helping someone else so my call was taken by the branch manager who took all of my information and filed a grievance on my behalf through chase s complaint and compliance department \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i was contacted by xxxx  id  xxxx  with the complaint and compliance department she said my information had been given to the research team who would look into the loans when they completed their search she would be back in touch with what they found \\n\\non xxxxxxxx xxxx called me back and said they had located specifics on the loans in question and directed me to the chase recovery and loan specialist department who would then be able to provide the appropriate documentation i was seeking \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted the loan specialist department and spoke to a woman who confirmed the loan numbers amounts and cosigner i asked why these loans were not showing up on any credit report and she stated that the loans  drop off as soon as they are cancelled  a statement that is absolutely false i requested copies of the original loan contracts and she said she would have them sent to me with no issue the contract was post marked xxxxxxxx and arrived xxxxxxxx however the contract she sent was not the correct loan contract it was not the correct dates amount or loan number\\n\\nrealizing that i wasnt getting anywhere my cosigner contacted chase on xxxxxxxx attempting to get the information i requested the man she spoke to again confirmed details but instead of sending contracts referred her to the irs for further questions \\n\\non xxxxxxxx my cosigner again contacted chase to directly request contract copies for these loans on this phone call she was told she was not a cosigner and therefore could not be given any information or sent any contracts \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted chase again and spoke to loan specialist   xxxx who confirmed that my cosigner was in fact on the loans she said the original loans were taken out between xxxx she said loans were charged off xxxxxxxx letters sent in xxxx and reported cancelled in xxxx this time she could not confirm the address the s were sent to she said she had no idea where the address came from  she also corrected previous information given and confirmed that these loans should be on our credit reports  she offered to send me to the credit reporting dept to  fix  the non reported loans  i declined  she said she had requested copies of the original contracts as well as copies of the s for these loans to be sent to me in business days unfortunately the only documentation she sent were s with the wrong address i have still yet to receive a single piece of paper relating to these loan contracts\\n\\nit has been months numerous phones calls and misinformation and i can not get any tangible proof that the loans reported cancelled on my name and social are in fact my loans and my responsibility i once again called chase on xxxxxxxx and asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge who could give me a definitive answer and send me concrete proof of these loans i was transferred to a voicemail left a very specific message with appropriate contact information and i have yet to receive a phone call back as of xxxxxxxx even though the voicemail greeting specifically states that a callback will take place within business hours

be done i explained that i had already spoken with xxxx in that department and that i was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her she stated that the supervisors in that

       "58   i made a purchase of on xxxxxxxx i made payments of on xxxxxxxx and on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of in xxxx the promotional balance was a difference of apparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase  was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx

       "82   i recently called to ask chase bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx

still being debited from my account this time i got a hold of xxxx her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd she told me that while they were  investigating  these open claims money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it finally on xxxxxxxx i received a voicemail from xxxx to call her as soon as possible i returned her call once school was dismissed for the day it was at that point that xxxx told me they closed their  investigation  of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision when asked what research they used to complete their  investigation  xxxx became short and told me i would have to subpoena the information at that point i hung up because i felt that it was a lose lose situation

       "213  my mortgage is with chase my payments were being made by xxxx xxxx xxxx paying early each month xxxx was the provider of xxxx to chase evidently xxxx was sold to xxxx on xxxx transferred the files and told xxxx that chase said i was bankrupt and to terminate the processes xxxx did and did not pay chase any longer i have received no communication from anyone on this i was going to open a checking account at chase today and noticed that my mortgage had not been paid i called and they said that xxxx will not pay them and have terminated me to bankruptcy which i am not in since the mortgage holder would know after much pain i was able to get a mortgage verification letter sent to xxxx so they can restart my payments however i had to make a complete payment pay late fees and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history \\n\\nxxxx was negligent with the files transfer and xxxx was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered \\n\\nwhat can be done i have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me no one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances i thought that i am entitled to all records about myself \\n\\ni am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run xxxx must have been really evil and xxxx doesnt really read what they are given or even contact the person xxxx did not let me know they were changing services \\n\\ni can provide only the mortgage verification from chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data they say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed evidently xxxx did not use a human review process to read only accept checked fields of bad records

       "287  i have a chase sapphire reserved card and the payment is due the first of the month to pay the bill i can go through the chase credit card website and it automatically draws the payment from my bank account the payment normally takes several hours to be completed although they do state that it can take up to two business days i normally schedule the payment two days in advance of when my payment is due to ensure that it is received on time taking into account weekends and how many business days there are before the first of the month \\n\\ni have made payments for this credit card on time for every single month however on at least four instances the credit card is saying payments have been late and they charge a late fee and interest charge for the first two instances i know i made the payments on time but the company said it was posted late and so they charged fees when i found out i called the credit card company and spoke to their customer service representative and eventually after talking to supervisors they acknowledged that their system inappropriately delayed when the payment was shown as posting and so they refunded the late fees and interest charged more recently for this past xxxx it occurred again and then for xxxx i went online and made the payment but when i got my statement for xxxx recently its saying that the payment was never received and so it charged late fees and interested for both xxxx and xxxx i am tying to talk to them to get them to address these situations as well and am hoping they will resolve it but its now seeming to be a pattern and i have heard from others who have this credit card  and other credit cards  that they experience this as well i dont know if its just errors in these companies  systems or if it is purposeful as a way for them to collect late fees and interest charges from unsuspecting customers i am lucky in that i am familiar with consumer protections laws and so know how to call them and challenge them but i worry that many consumers wont notice or wont know how to challenge them and so just pay them i am wondering if others have complained about this to cfpb and so perhaps it is in fact a pattern that requires investigation thank you for your time and consideration and for all you do to help protect consumers across the country

       "317  ive been actively trying to resolve this concern with chase bank for the longest time since i was reported late days twice on my credit report due to no fault of my own \\n\\ni have spoke and confirmed this with a chase representative who agreed with me the system chase uses is false and leads to misinformation regarding accounts \\n\\nthe chase system does not show correct account activity when payments are made to their auto loan accounts until the entire balance is processed on its own \\n\\nsince the beginning of the lease ive had nothing but trouble trying to have my payments made and processed through chase without being charged some late fee when my payments are made on time \\n\\nback in xxxx i noticed the payments i had been sending to chase for my car were not being reflected on the balance my car payment due is each month if i submit a payment for that payment does not get applied to the balance whatsoever it will still reflect an amount of instead of thats is owed which is misleading and completely not fair \\n\\nit leads me to not know exactly how much is due after processing payments because even under recent activity it does not show the past payments ive made on the account only payments ive made months prior show up and not recent made payments \\n\\nits not fair chase does not apply the amounts ive paid to my car to help show the right balance due on my car this purposely misleads customers like me and we end up being penalized for not paying when weve processed multiple payments to our loan \\n\\ni should have not been reported late days for a past due balance of when i had made those payments and if chase updated the balances correctly customers such as myself would not have been reported late \\n\\nim kindly asking for chase to review and kindly update my credit report to reflect good standing due to bank errors that dont seem to get resolved

did after the item arrived i called xxxx on xxxxxxxx to verify the promotional apr since it was not showing on the chase online banking site for the xxxx xxxx card i was told by xxxx rep xxxx that it was eligible but that the promotions were handled by chase i then called chase and spoke with xxxx who confirmed the apr and said that my payments of would be reflected on my xxxxxxxx statement however when we got the statement that was not the case i called chase on xxxxxxxx and was told by xxxx that they would listen to the recording of the xxxxxxxx call and get back to me yesterday they called back and informed me that  yes xxxx had said that but he was wrong and you will not get the promotional apr  i then spent two hours on the phone with xxxx and chase trying to get this resolved each of them says it is the other s responsibility and no one at either company was able help me even though i talked to eight different people today i spoke with xxxx  a us supervisor at xxxx  who told me  that they had numerous complaints about chase not honoring these promotions but that there was nothing xxxx could do for me  cfpb please help me thank you

       "383  on xxxxxxxx i made an additional principal payment towards the principal of our mortgage i sent the coupon from the bottom of the statement and wrote in the amount of which was to be put towards the principal only when i reviewed my account on xxxxxxxx i noticed that they had put around directly towards principal and applied the remaining to interest escrow and  fees  i contacted them via email on xxxxxxxx to explain that this payment was for additional principal only as of today i have not received an email explaining why this payment was incorrectly processed on xxxxxxxx i made a principal payment of and that payment was posted exactly as it should be i have never been late and pay extra on principal nearly every month i want this reversed and the entire applied directly to

       "399  my wife and i have had a traditional xxxx yr mortgage with chase  account xxxx  since xxxx we were never delinquent on a payment each month chase sends me a monthly statement with a coupon for the next payment in xxxxxxxx i never recieved their statement or coupon and i did not send in my xxxx mortgage payment i recieved the statement  coupon for xxxx and xxxx was paid on time the first week of xxxx i was contacted by chase telling me our mortgage was delinquent i looked into it and agreed that i missed xxxx s payment and made payments in the next week to catch up now we are trying to apply for a line of credit but were denied as chase reported we were delinquent x payments i say we were delinquent for payment as when i was notified that our xxxx payment was never made i paid it plus our regular xxxx payment in the next few days \\nnow due to this error we have been denied a line of credit we need for expenses for an upcoming child s wedding not to mention the negative impact this has had on our credit score

       "420  i have been attempting for months to get chase bank to correct a negative report  plus days late  on my credit report they have refused to cooperate claiming the report is accurate  i filed disputes with the credit reporting agencies to no avail  i even retained an attorney  chase ignored her letters the payment in question was only two weeks late and the reason it was late is due to the fact that my automatic payments needed to be reauthorized and i was not informed of this fact once i realized the payment was late i immediately phoned chase to make the payment and reauthorized the automatic payments in short i have acted in good faith  and chase has refused to do the same \\n\\nthe document attached shows the payment going out on the payment was due on the xxxx

       "432  i purchased xxxx xxxx xxxx tickets through chase ultimate rewards portal on xxxx but i was not provided the tickets even after making full payment using my chase reward points the tickets were for visit to xxxx on xxxx i have called chase multiple times on xxxx and they are unable to provide a voucher even after receiving full payment this is complete deficiency in service further their call center employees put me on hold for several hours combined causing me mental agony and lost holiday time i didnt want to spend my holidays on calls with chase customer care the employees were not helpful and made false assurances on recorded conversations which were not fulfilled chase will be liable for all losses money time and otherwise incurred by me and my family due to such deficiency in service further the call center employees wanted to put me on a minute hold and refused to arrange a call back making me a virtual employee of chase without adequate consideration

of interest in xxxx of xxxx after that my wife had a baby and was out of work for three months she kept paying until xxxx but then could no longer afford the extra  interest after that they also added  xxxxmonth late fees i met with my lawyer this week and he said for her to call them and have them remove me chase bank told her she had to make a payment of in order to remove me which she clearly doesnt have she called again today and after being transferred all over the place for nearly an hour she eventually talked to someone who could help her she offered to make a payment of if they would remove my name they finally agreed that they would remove my name if she made a direct payment from her bank account of however as soon as she made the payment they still refused to take my name off

       "527  i purchased my home through chase mortgage in as a first time homebuyer on an escrow payment of was applied directly to the escrow account going forward the original agreement signed in good faith indicated of the monthly payment would go towards the escrow account to cover insurance and property taxes i set up an auto pay for so additional principal would also be applied these amounts were paid and applied appropriately until the payment on where the escrow payment applied was dropped to down from the to continue paying the insurance but not the property taxes without my knowledge or consent i was confused and unsure as to why this happened but being a firsttime homebuyer assumed that because the previous home owner had a homestead exemption that granted him complete exemption from property taxes the taxes may have been reassessed and with already almost in the escrow account the monthly amount withdrawn could now be reduced believing the bank would apply funds as necessary i did not change my automatic payment  i continued the autopay that was set up to pay the monthly mortgage amount dictated by the bank plus the additional principal \\n\\nrecently i noticed a message on my online chase mortgage account that indicating my monthly payment would be changed once again but this time from to it appears that because the bank failed to continue applying escrow towards the property taxes they are now unfairly demanding that i double up on tax payments this year to clear last year s property taxes and put money into escrow for this year s property taxes of the payment it appears they are applying towards  escrow shortage   short due to the bank s error   and towards property taxes as you can imagine nearly doubling the monthly payment on a mortgage would no doubt create a severe financial hardship on a single mother i feel the bank was misleading and deceptive in their erroneous practice of changing the monthly payment without my consent and then expecting me to pay twice the amount in property to make up for their mistake
